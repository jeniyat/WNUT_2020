Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef, approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis.
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay.
Fragments were washed in autoclaved, 0.02 μm filtered virus-free seawater.
Subsequently, tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton, using an air-gun, into 15 mL 0.02 μm filtered (Anotop, Whatman) SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in a zip-lock bag.
Briefly, 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature.
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min (Heidolph SilentCrusher™).
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min.
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells (Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor).
A cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7, 1.5, and 1.35 g mL−1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear™ ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient.
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.
In the MECH method, the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min.
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min.
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) (Sigma-Aldrich).
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min.
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients.
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles, two dsDNA viruses, OtV-2 (Weynberg et al., 2011) and EhV-86 (Wilson et al., 2005b), were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol.
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption.
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase (Ambion) prior to nucleic acid extraction.
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit (Epicentre, Illumina) following manufacturer 's instructions.
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer 's instructions, including the final DNase step (Ambion).
Two different amplification methods were used.
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification (MDA), such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes, DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification.
Triplicate 10 μ L aliquots of the DNA extractions, containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes, underwent a single round of Klenow reaction (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μ L) by mixing 1.5 μ L of 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Buffer 2), 1.5 μ L of dNTPs (2.5 mM stock), 1 μ L of random hexamer primers (50 ng/μ L, Invitrogen).
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μ L of Klenow (3′–5′ exo-) was added and incubated at 25°C for 10 min.
It was then incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75°C for 20 min.
After termination, reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 μL of Buffer AE.
Replicate MDA reactions (n = 3 for each sample) were amplified using 2.5 μ L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG® kit using the standard protocol.
All reactions were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification, pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 μ L of Buffer AE.
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present.
As with the RepliG® protocol, Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3′ random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification.
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer, 5 μL of nucleic acid was added to 9 μL reaction mix containing : The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL, NEB #) was added and incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction (3′–5′ exo) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer, by adding an additional 1 μL of primer and 1 μL dNTP.
The reaction then underwent a 94°C for 3 min heating step.
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min.
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-).
The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
The reaction was then terminated at 75°C for 20 min.
Briefly, in preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 μ L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 μ L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 μ L of FR26RV-N (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN, 10 μ M stock) and FR40RV-T primer (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC (T) 20, 50 nM stock).
The reaction was heated to 65°C for 5 min.
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, 1 μL DTT (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 μL RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase.
The reaction was incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly (T) 20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced.
The temperature was then increased to 50°C for 60 min.
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 1 μL Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL).
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 20 min.
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template (DNA and RNA) was done in triplicate 25 μL reactions containing : The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at : The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1×TAE at 100 V for 30 min.
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products (typically a smear ; products should be longer than 250 bp), a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows.
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 μL of pooled SISPA reaction template, 10 μL 10× buffer, 16 μL dNTP (2.5 mM stock), 8 μL FR20RV primer (10 μ M stock) and 0.75 μL TaKaRa LA HS Taq.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at : Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed.
After amplification, samples were cleaned with a QIAamp® DNA Mini kit (RepliG® amplification) or a MinElute® PCR purification kit (RP-SISPA).
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen® kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer, for quality (260:280 ratios) on a NanoDrop 2000, and were run on a 0.8 % agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing (~250–500 bp) was present without contamination of smaller fragments.
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads, adaptor sequences were trimmed, and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp.
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp.
To carry out the taxonomic assignment, these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server, which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes (http : //metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr) (Roux et al., 2011).
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit.
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir.
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981, SRR1207983, SRR1207980, SRR1207984, and SRR1246941 (Table 1 in guidelines).
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582.

Add 600 µL of 60 % (w/w) CsCl to each tube.
Heat the tubes at 75°C for 15 min.
Layer the samples onto pre-formed 40-60 % (w/w) CsCl gradients in SW60 rotor tubes (to make a final 30-60 % gradient).
Add 1200 µL of the heated virus to each gradient.
Centrifuge the gradients in SW60 rotors at 35,000 rpm, 18 hours, 25°C.
Remove the DNA bands from the gradients with a wide bent needle to silicon-coated 30 mL corex tubes.
Extract the Hoechst dye from the DNA by adding an equal volume of CsCl/TE-saturated isopropanol to the DNA solution, mixing gently by inversion, centrifuge for 1 min at 3,000 rpm in the Sorvall to separate the phases, and pipet off the upper isopropanol layer.
Repeat last step.
Add 1.0 mL of 3 M NaOAc to each tube and adjust the volume of each tube to 10.0 mL with 1X TE buffer.

Viruses from Sulfolobus and close relatives
For each sample to be collected, one anaerobic collection vessel (Fig 1A in guidelines) is prepared.
A small amount (ca. 50–220 mg) of elemental sulfur (e.g., Riedel-deHaën) is placed in an anaerobic tube.
0.1 mL of a 2 % resazurin solution and 0.1 mL of water saturated with H2S are added.
The air in the tube is displaced with CO2 and N2 by the Hungate technique and the tube is stoppered (Hungate et al. 1966).
A cap is placed on the tube and the assemblage autoclaved.
Liquid and wet sediment samples are collected from turbid terrestrial hot springs with high temperature > 70˚C and low pH < 4.
Samples are collected in sterile 50-mL conical flasks at the end of an extendible pole with a clamp (see Fig. 1A in guidelines).
After most of the sediment is allowed to settle, the pH of the liquid is carefully adjusted to ca. 5.5 with solid CaCO3 by slow addition and stirring.
Once the pH is adjusted the sample is transferred to a pre-prepared anaerobic tube using a syringe (see above and Fig. 1A in guidelines).
If the resazurin indicator changes to pink, drops of H2S-saturated water are added until the sample clears.
Samples can be maintained for up to 2 weeks at room temperature before enrichment.
Samples collected either in anaerobic tubes or filled centrifuge tubes are diluted 1:50 or 1:100 in Sulfolobus growth medium* (Zillig et al. 1994).
Incubate samples at 80˚C with shaking (150 rpm) for up to 2 weeks.
The medium was buffered with 0.7 g glycine per liter and the pH was adjusted to pH 3–3.5 with 1:2 diluted sulfuric acid.
For long-term 80˚C growth, our favorite bath liquid is PEG 400, which is a noncorrosive, nontoxic, water soluble compound that does not evaporate (see Fig. 1B in guidelines).
When growth is detected by either an increase in turbidity or production of a characteristic “ damp sock ” odor (W. Zillig pers. comm.), samples are plated on Gelrite® plates (see below and Fig. lC in guidelines), rediluted 1:50, and screened for VLP production by a spot-onlawn assay (see below and Fig. 1D in guidelines) or electron microscopy (see below and Fig. 2 in guidelines).
The second round of enrichment culture is also plated and screened for virus production.
Plates are made by slowly adding 6–10 grams/L Gelrite (Kelco) to Sulfolobus media (see above) and boiling until dissolved.
Calcium (Ca (NO3) 2) and magnesium (MgCl2) are added to a final concentration of 1.5 and 5 mM, respectively, to stabilize the gel.
Before the gel solidifies, ca. 25 mL is poured into standard (90 mm) Petri plates with cams.
After the Gelrite solidifies, plates can be stored at 4˚C indefinitely.
Approximately 0.1 mL, from undiluted to 10-3, of enrichment cultures are spread on Gelrite plates in the presence or absence of 0.5 mL 0.2 % Gelrite dissolved in Sulfolobus medium.
Plates are incubated inverted in airtight moist containers at 75–80˚C for approximately 1 week before colonies appear (Fig. 1C in guidelines).

Preparing Biological Samples for Column Chemistry
Filtering Cultures 1.1 Oxalate Wash Preparation Before filtration, make an oxalate wash that will be used in order to remove extracellular iron from diatoms.
Mix consecutively from a to f in 600 ml of ultra pure.
Take up to 1 L ultra pure once Ph 8 is reached.
15.3g, EDTA ; 14.7g, Sodium Citrate ; 0.74g, Potassium Chloride ; 5g, Sodium Chloride ;
Several drops of Sodium Hydroxide until a Ph of 6-712.6g, Oxalic Acid is 1.2.
Harvest Diatoms Once They Have Been Filtered :
Once cultures have been grown to their optimal density (approximately 3500 RFU), they need to be harvested.
In order to do so, the following items are needed : a pair of tweezers that have been cleaned in 10 % HCl overnight, polycarbonate filters (0.1um) that have been washed in 10 % HCl overnight and rinsed in UPW, 3 bottles : one to collect waste, one that contains ASW and one that contains UPW, oxalate wash, a 60ml syringe, and syringe filter tip.
Label several 15ml tubes with the designated solution numbers on them.
One tube should be labeled for unwashed solutions and a separate tube labeled for washed solutions.
For example, the tubes may say, “ solution 1 # 1 unwashed ”, “ solution 1 # 2 washed ”.
Once tubes are labeled, assemble the filtration apparatus.
Use polyethylene gloves to handle the tweezers, remove one polycarbonate filter from its container and place on the filter rig.
Screw the reservoir onto the filter rig and rinse the filter with UPW, allowing the water to be filtered through.
Pour 250ml of culture onto the filter and allow it to drain.
Rinse the filter three times with 5ml of ASW.
Once filter has completely drained, unscrew the reservoir with polyethylene gloves, remove the filter with tweezers, and place it in the corresponding 15ml tube that is labeled “ unwashed ”.
Syringe filter 60ml of oxalate wash into the remaining 750ml of culture.
Invert bottle once and allow to sit for 30min.
Invert bottle a second time and place a new polycarbonate filter onto the filter rig, rinse with UPW and pour the remaining culture onto filter.
Rinse filter three times with 5ml ASW, drain completely, remove filter, and place in corresponding tube labeled “ washed ”.
Repeat these steps until all of the 1L bottles have been filtered.
Rinse tweezers with UPW as well as the filter rig, and put everything back in its place.
Rinse the bottles out with UPW and take them to the clean lab to be cleaned.
All cultures, once filtered, need to be run through columns in order to examine iron limitation.
Preparation for Isotopic Analysis Transfer filter to a clean 15 mL tube for storage.
Transfer the filter into a small teflon (PFA) vial.
Add 1 mL conc.
TE clean HCl and 1 mL conc.
TE clean HNO3 to each vial.
CAREFUL : This reaction will produce a corrosive and foul-smelling orange gas.
Place caps loosely on vials and place vials in a fume hood.
IF YOU DECIDE TO PUT THEM ON A HOT PLATE, DO NOT TURN ON HEAT.
(If hotplate is not available, find another good place to store them overnight in a fume hood.)
After the samples have reacted overnight, remove the filters from the vials with a pair of teflon tweezers.
Try to pick up the filter in a way that most of the remaining diatom shells remain on the filter.
The filter will also have a lot of the acid still in it, and this acid contains valuable amounts of Fe.
Rinse off this acid back into the PFA vial by twice pipetting 1 mL of TE H2O over each filter.
Evaporate samples to dryness on a hot plate.
Reconstitute samples in 200 uL of 10N HCl +0.001 % H2O2.
Collect a subsample before samples are run through columns.
Run samples through ‘ mini ’ columns (135 uL) according to established procedures.
While running columns, clean each of your PFA vials by blasting then with TE water from the tap and putting them on the hot plate with 0.1 N HNO3 for an hour or two as columns run.
Elute from the columns into the same PFA vials your samples came out of.
Dry down overnight (or for a few hours).
Re dissolve in 100ul of conc. HNO3.
Put on hot plate in bio lab, capped, for 30min at 350.
Take off hot plate in clean lab and put on hot plate in biological lab to dry down.
Reconstitute in 1100ul 0.1N HNO3 Take off 100ul of sample and dilute to 1ml with .1N HNO3, put in 15 ml vial.
Give the sample from the step above to Tim to run on element.
(This gives the concentration that allows you to calculate step 22).
When you have calculated the amount of Fe in each sample, add enough double-spike to get a 1:2 sample : spike ratio.
The sample is ready for isotopic analysis.

The charcoal sticks so it is best to dedicate a flask for washing (and other treatment steps).
Add 10g of activated charcoal to the NaCl2 solution.
Add stir bar.
Stir for at least 10min.
Recover the charcoal by filtration upon a glass fiber (GF/F) filter using a designated filter rig.
Use a scoopula to add washed charcoal to the sterilized seawater made in Step1.
Take care not to rip the GF/F filter.
Obtain the remaining charcoal in the rig by swirling sterilzed water in the filtration rig and pouring that out into your flask with the sterilzed seawater (and now washed charcoal).
Stir the washed charcoal plus sterilzed seawater for at least 30min, using a stir plate.
Remove charcoal from the seawater by filtering the mixture using a disposable filtration rig with a 0.2 μm filter.
After removing the charcoal and any larger than 0.2 μm particles, work in a sterile environment (laminar flow hood recommended) and aseptically add desired nutrient requirements to your seawater to complete your medium.
Time Efficient Method for Washing 15 mL Vials
Arrange vials so that they all sit upright in a large plastic cage.
I ’ ve found you can usually fit about 60 vials (a bit more than one bag) into a single cage.
Place caps into a small cage.
Place cages upright into a soap bath overnight.
Place a large piece of PTFE over the cages to keep them submerged.
Remove cages from soap, and rinse thoroughly 7 times to remove soap.
It ’ s important to make sure that water gets into each individual vial, so move the cage back and forth until each of the vials is at least partially filled.
When pouring the water back out, make sure to shake the cage so that in interior of all the vials is rinsed.
Rinse the outsides in between rinsing the vial interiors.
Place cages upright into a 1N HCl bath.
Once or twice during the week, invert and/or rotate all of the cages (vials and caps) to make sure all surfaces are exposed.
Remove vials and caps from the bath and rinse each cage 7 times to remove most of the HCl.
Clean an area in the drying bench with a clean wipe, and place cages into the drying bench.
With thoroughly cleaned and rinsed poly gloves, remove each vial from the cage and individually rinse the vial plus one cap three times.
Stand in front of the flow bench to shake out excess water, cap vial, and place in a bag for storage.

Modified Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250μl Buffer P1 and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube.
Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.
No cell clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet.
If LyseBlue reagent has been added to Buffer P1, vigorously shake the buffer bottle to ensure LyseBlue particles are completely dissolved.
The bacteria should be resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps remain.
Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
Mix gently by inverting the tube.
Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA.
If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.
Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
If LyseBlue has been added to Buffer P1 the cell suspension will turn blue after addition of Buffer P2.
Mixing should result in a homogeneously colored suspension.
If the suspension contains localized colorless regions or if brownish cell clumps are still visible, continue mixing the solution until a homogeneously colored suspension is achieved.
Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
To avoid localized precipitation, mix the solution thoroughly, immediately after addition of Buffer N3.
Large culture volumes (e.g.
≥5 ml) may require inverting up to 10 times.
The solution should become cloudy.
If LyseBlue reagent has been used, the suspension should be mixed until all trace of blue has gone and the suspension is colorless.
A homogeneous colorless sus- pension indicates that the SDS has been effectively precipitated.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.

A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses
Whole seawater (if intracellular viruses are to be included in the analysis) or 0.22-filtered seawater (if only the free virus community is targeted) is gently filtered (7 mmHg) through a 0.02 µm aluminum oxide filter (Anotop, Whatman).
Filtration should continue until the rate slows dramatically or drops to zero.
Use pumped air to remove as much residual sample as possible.
Once dry, seal the filter inlets and outlets with parafilm.
Label the filter.
Flash-freeze the filter in liquid nitrogen.
Store it at –80°C until extraction.
Total nucleic acids are extracted from the aluminum oxide filters using a Masterpure complete DNA and RNA Purification kit (Epicenter, Biotechnologies).
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems) as described in the protocol provided with the kit.
Each cDNA reaction contains 11 µL of extracted Turbo DNA-free–treated RNA template, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, and 100 ng of N6 primer in a total volume of 13 µL.
Denaturation and annealing of the primers to the RNA template occurs by heating the sample to 65°C for 5 min and then cooling it on ice.
While still on ice, DTT (0.5 mM final conc.) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U Superscript III (Invitrogen) Reverse Transcriptase.
The final reaction volume should be 20 µL.
The reaction is incubated initially at 25°C for 5 min so that the relatively unstable hexamer primers remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences.
The temperature is then increased to 50°C, the temperature at which Superscript III ’ s processivity is highest, for 60 min.
The activity of the enzyme is terminated by incubating the reaction at 85°C for 5 min.
After cDNA synthesis, add 1 µL (2 U) of RNase H (Invitrogen) to the reaction and incubate at 37°C for 20 min to digest the RNA template from the cDNA : RNA molecule.
PCR can be performed with the RdRp, Mpl.sc1, Mpl.sc2, Mplsc3, and Mpl.cdh primer sets listed in Table 1 and the cDNA synthesized in the previous step.
In a 0.2 mL nuclease-free PCR tube, add reaction components to achieve final concentrations of 1× Platinum Taq buffer, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1 µM of each primer, and 1 unit of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).
Incubate the reactions with the following thermal cycling conditions : 94°C for 75 s (this is necessary to activate the enzyme and ensures complete initial denaturation of template), followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at a primer-specific temperature (Table 1) for 45 s, and extension at 72°C for 45 s.
Complete the cycle with a single final extension step of 9 min 15 s at 72°C.
Before gel separation, we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1 % agarose gel containing 1× SYBR safe stain (Invitrogen) and 0.5× TBE buffer.
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size (approximately 500 bp) are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions.
We recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 µL nuclease-free water in preparation for the end repair reaction.
In preparation for ligation, PCR products are polished and phosphorylated with the PCRTerminator End Repair kit (Lucigen) as described by the manufacturer.
After a 15-min incubation at room temperature the reaction is purified and concentrated with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup column (Qiagen).
The eluted PCR products are subsequently ligated into the pSMART-HCKan vector (Lucigen) according to the manufacturer.
After terminating the ligation reaction by incubating for 15 min at 70°C, 2 µL of the ligation reaction is transformed into Ecloni 10G Supreme cells (Lucigen) via electroporation.
Before initiating a large-scale sequencing effort, we recommend screening 10 to 20 colonies for inserts by PCR amplification with the primers SL1 and SR2 (Table 1) to assess the quality of the library.
Colony PCR products can be visualized on a gel and the products in the correct size range purified and sequenced.

Isolation of Haloviruses from Natural Waters
Salt lake samples are collected from hypersaline waters, which typically range from 15 % w/v total salt, up to saturation (ca 35 %).
Samples are collected in sterile 5–10 mL vessels and may be stored for several weeks at room temperature.
In the laboratory, cells and cellular debris are removed by centrifugation (5,000g, 10 min, room temperature).
The supernatant is then screened directly for viruses by plaque assay.
The choice of host strains depends on the experimental objectives, and includes well-characterized members of the Halobacteriaceae, such as Hbt.
salinarum (host for ΦH and several others) or Har.
hispanica (host for SH1, His1, His2, and others), or natural isolates from the same source, such as Hrr.
coriense (host for HF2).
Base and overlay plates (90 mm) are made with MGM (see guidelines), solidified using 15 % w/v agar.
A range of salt water concentrations should be examined, because salt concentration seems to greatly affect the size and clarity of plaques.
Plates can be stored indefinitely at 4°C (wrapped in plastic to prevent dessication), but should be warmed to room temperature or warmer for use.
For virus isolation, 100–500 µl of the cleared water sample is mixed with 150 µl of exponentially growing host cells.
Then, 3–4 mL of molten (50°C) top-layer MGM (with 0.7 % w/v agar) is added, and the solution mixed gently and poured evenly over the plate.
After setting on a level surface for 5–10 min, plates are incubated aerobically, inverted in airtight containers at 30°C and 37°C for 1–4 d, and checked every day for plaques.
Any visible plaques are picked using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, or sterile plastic micropipette tips.
These agar plugs are then transferred to tubes containing 500 µl of halovirus diluent : 2.47 M, NaCl ; 90 mM, MgCl2 ; 90 mM, MgSO4 ; 60 mM, KCl ; 3 mM, CaCl2 ; 10 mM, Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 ;
They are then vortexed to homogenize the sample.
These suspensions are then replaqued on overlay plates to purify the isolates and to eliminate “ false plaques ” caused by artifacts in the agar overlay or contaminants in the water sample.

The host cells are grown overnight in liquid cultures containing an appropriate growth medium for the organism.
Measure optical density spectrophotometrically at 525 nm (OD525) and adjust OD to 0.3–0.5 with growth medium.
Soft agar (0.5 to 0.6 % agar in media of choice) is melted in a water bath or a microwave oven.
Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use.
200–300 µL bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar.
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium.
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate, which is placed on a flat surface.
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified, triplicate aliquots of 5–10 µL of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar.
As a negative control 5–10 µL phage buffer (e.g., SM buffer : 450 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris, 0.01 % Gelatin, pH = 8) or 0.02 µm filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar.
The plates are incubated for 1–3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria, and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone (plaque) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate.
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area, this indicates the presence of lytic phages, which can be isolated and purified.
Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone, phages are further isolated and purified from the plates.
Stellaris® RNA FISH Alternative Protocol for Adherent Cells
Grow cells on 18 mm round # 1 coverglass in a 12-well cell culture plate.
Aspirate growth medium, and wash with 1 mL of 1X PBS.
To fix and permeabilize cells, add 1 mL of methanol-acetic acid (MeOH-AcOH) fixation solution.
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Cells can be stored at +2 to +8 °C in MeOH-AcOH up to 48 hours before hybridization.
Do not use a coverglass containing adherent cells if the MeOH-AcOH has completely evaporated.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 1 μL of probe stock solution to 100 μL of Hybridization Buffer, and then vortex and centrifuge (enough for one coverglass).
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used on steps d and e.
Aspirate the MeOH-AcOH off the coverglass containing adherent cells within the 12-well plate.
Add 1 mL of Wash Buffer A (see recipe above), and incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes.
Assemble humidified chamber : 150 mm tissue culture plate ; bottom lined evenly with a flat water-saturated paper towel and a single layer of Parafilm placed on top of the paper towel.
This chamber will help prevent evaporation of the probe solution from under the coverglass.
Within the humidified chamber, dispense 100 μL of the Hybridization Buffer containing probe onto the Parafilm.
Gently transfer the coverglass, cells side down, onto the 100 μL drop of Hybridization Buffer containing probe.
Cover the humidified chamber with the tissue culture lid, and seal with Parafilm.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 2 hours.
(Incubation can be continued up to 16 hours).
Gently transfer the coverglass, cells side up, to a fresh 12-well plate containing 1 mL of Wash Buffer A.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Aspirate Wash Buffer A, and then add 1 mL of DAPI nuclear stain (Wash Buffer A consisting of 5 ng/mL DAPI) to counterstain the nuclei.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Aspirate the DAPI staining buffer, and then add 1 mL of Wash Buffer B.
Incubate at room temperature for 2-5 minutes.

Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit Protocol
Add 5 volumes of Buffer PB to 1 volume of the PCR sample and mix.
It is not necessary to remove mineral oil or kerosene.
If pH indicator I has beein added to Buffer PB, check that the color of the mixture is yellow.
If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and mix.
The color of the mixture will turn to yellow.
Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.
To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s. Discard flow-through.
Place the QIAquick column back into the same tube.
To wash, add 0.75 ml Buffer PE to the QIAquick column and centrifuge for 30–60 s.
Discard flow-through and place the QIAquick column back in the same tube.
Centrifuge the column for an additional 1 min.
IMPORTANT : Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation.
Place QIAquick column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
To elute DNA, add 50 µl Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water (pH 7.0–8.5) to the center of the QIAquick membrane and centrifuge the column for 1 min.
Alternatively, for increased DNA concentration, add 30 µl elution buffer to the center of the QIAquick membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge.
IMPORTANT : Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane for complete elution of bound DNA.
The average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl elution buffer.
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH.
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5.
When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time.
Refer to Table 2 (page 15) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.

Remove as much ethanol as possible without disturbing the pellet Leave tube open on bench ~ 15 minutes.
Dissolve in TE buffer (~ pH 7.6).
Estimation of viral-induced phytoplankton mortality using the modified dilution method
To create the grazer-free diluent whole seawater is gravity filtered through acid-washed 0.2–0.45 µm filters (e.g., PALL Acropak™ Supor® membrane capsules) into a clean carboy.
After gravity filtration half of the grazer-free diluent is passed through a tangential flow filtration system with kilodalton (kDa) pore size to create the virus-free diluent.
The grazer-free and virus-free diluents are added to 10-L polycarbonate bottles in the correct proportions to create the parallel t0 dilution series, e.g., 20 %, 40 %, 70 %, and 100 % whole water.
The mesoplankton-free whole water is then gently added by siphoning.
From each of these t0 bottles, triplicate 1-L polycarbonate bottles were rinsed twice and then gently filled by siphoning (to minimize physical damage to the grazers, viruses, and phytoplankton populations), ensuring that bottles are filled completely to avoid trapping air bubbles inside upon closure.
After filling, triplicate experimental bottles are placed randomly into experimental conditions.
For determination of phytoplankton composition and abundance and virus abundance, triplicate subsamples (5 mL) are taken from the 10 L t0 dilution bottles and the 0.2–0.45-µm and kDa diluents.
Initial (t0) and final (t24) phytoplankton composition and abundance estimates are typically determined by analysis of samples using flow cytometry
Apparent phytoplankton growth rates (µ, d–1) are calculated from each experimental bottle as the changes in abundance during the incubation using the equation : µ = ln (Pt/Po) /t.
The actual dilution rate is calculated by dividing the t0 phytoplankton abundance in each bottle by the averaged abundance of the replicate t0 100 % counts (3–6 bottles).

Preparation of deionized glyoxal
Mix 25 ml of 40 % glyoxal to be deionized with 2.5 g of mixed bed resin.
Mix the solution by magnetic stirrer for 30 minutes at room temperature.
The resin color will change from blue to amber, when its capacity is reached.
Separate the deionized material from the resin by decanting or (sterile) filtration.
Repeat the deionization process (steps 2. and 4.)
until the color of the resin does not change anymore.
Approximately half of the resin particles remain blue and half become amber after a 30-minute incubation.
Check the pH of the glyoxal solution by mixing 200 μl of glyoxal with 2 μl of a 10 mg/ml aqueous solution of bromocresol green and observing the color change.
Bromocresol green is yellow at pH < 4.8 and blue-green at pH > 5.2.
Alternatively, use pH indicator strips instead of a bromocresol green solution.
Repeat the deionization process (steps 2. and 4.)
until the pH of the glyoxal is > 5.5.
Final resin removal should be done through a small pore-size filter (e.g. 0.22-0.45 µm, gamma sterilized) to avoid carry-over of the resin.
Deionized glyoxal can be stored indefinitely at -20 °C (or -80 °C) under nitrogen in tightly sealed small aliquots (e.g. microcentrifuge tubes) .Use each aliquot only once, then discard.
