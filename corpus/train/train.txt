MojoSort™ Human CD14 Selection Kit Protocol
Prepare cells from your tissue of interest without lysing erythrocytes.
In the final wash of your sample preparation, resuspend the cells in MojoSort™ Buffer by adding up to 4mL in a 5 mL (12 x 75 mm) polystyrene tube.
Note: Keep MojoSort™ Buffer on ice throughout the procedure.
Filter the cells with a 70 μm cell strainer, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes, and resuspend in an appropriate volume of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Count and adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 108 cells/mL.
Aliquot 100 μL of cell suspension (107 cells) into a new tube.
Add 10 μL of the biotin anti-human CD14,mix well and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
Scale up the volume accordingly if separating more cells.
For example, add 100 μL for 1 x 108 cells.
When working with less than 107 cells, use indicated volumesfor 107 cells.
Optional: Keep unused cells, or take an aliquot before adding the cocktail to monitor purity and yield.
Resuspend the beads by vortexing, maximum speed, 5 touches.
Without washing, add 10 μL of Streptavidin Nanobeads.
Mix well and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
Scale up the volume accordingly if separating more cells.
For example, add 100 μL for 1 x 108 cells.
When working with less than 107 cells, use indicated volumes for 107 cells.
Resuspend the cells in 3 mL of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Note: If you observe aggregates, filter the suspension.
To maximize yield, you can disrupt the aggregates by pipetting the solution up and down.
Place the tube in the magnet for 5 minutes.
Pour out and collect the liquid.
These are your cells of interest; DO NOT DISCARD.
If needed, add 3 mL of MojoSort™ Buffer and repeat steps 10 and 11 with the magnetically labeled fraction up to two times, and then pool the unlabeled fractions.
Note: Repeating the magnetic separation increases the yield, without a strong impact on the purity.
The yield will typically increase about 8 – 10% with a second separation, and about 2 – 5% with a third separation.
The purity may decrease 1 – 2% with each separation.
Optional: Take a small aliquot before placing the tube in the magnet to monitor purity and yield.
Chlorophyll Extraction in Cyanobacteria

Use 90% methanol as the reference solution.
Obtaining pure phage stock
Transfer phages from the clearing zone on the plate to 1 mL phage buffer or sterile sea water in a sterile tube by scraping off the surface layer of the soft agar containing the phages using a sterile loop.
Allow the phages to diffuse into the medium overnight at 4°C.
Vortex the tube and centrifuge the sample (10,000 x g, 10 min) to remove bacteria and agar.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
This sample will typically contain 106–108 phages mL–1.
To isolate single phages, dilutions of this concentrate should be done, followed by plaque assay, and subsequent isolation of phages from single plaques.
Usually, this procedure is repeated 3 times to dilute out any contaminant phage associated with the phage of interest and increase the probability that only one specific phage is present in the final phage stock.
In the end, the phage concentrate is 0.2 µm filtered and kept in the fridge.
Enumerating algal viruses by flow cytometry

Dilute sample in 0.02-µm-filtered 1X TE buffer according to the Dilution Table.
NOTE: For a new sample, prepare multiple dilutions to test and determine the most appropriate dilution factor.
Stagger these dilutions/staining by ~5 minutes to allow for sample loading and back-flushing between dilution tests.
Prepare a 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube for staining by adding 2.5 µL of 100X SYBR Green I nucleic acid stain (this can be pre-aliquoted and kept in the dark at room temperature).
Add 497.5 µL of the diluted sample to the staining tube (0.5X SYBR Green I final conc) and mix by pipetting and gentle vortexing.
Incubate the diluted/stained sample for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
After incubation, transfer 480 µL of the stained sample to a 5 mL round bottom tube.
Add 10 µL 3° Grn and 10 µL 4° YG beads to the 5 mL tube.

Run immediately on LOW voltage settings: Trigger = TFSC, TFSC = 27, PFSC = 19, SSC = 40, 520 = 40, 572 = 40, 692 = 40.
Load sample for 2 min, run for 2-4 min (depending on concentration), and back-flush for 2 min.Sea stars bacterial sampling
Collected sea stars by hand. 
Rinse the location for sampling of the star with sterile seawater to remove any transient microbes.
This is important since the stars are in constant contact with environmental microbes and our sequencing technique is very sensitive; therefore, rinsing reduces noise.
For healthy individuals the sampling site (where the swabbing will occur) should be approximately 15 by 10 cm.
Remove a clean sterile swab from its wrapping and the cotton tip should be applied to the previously rinsed sample location.
The swab should be pulled across the sample location with moderate pressure.
One ‘swab’ consists of pulling the swab back and forth one; this should be done 10 times.
The swab should be placed into a labeled sterile screw cap tube and then kept on ice until it can be frozen at -80° Swabs are then ready for DNA extraction.
Previously we have used a MoBio PowerSoil Kit.

Immerse the slide in 100% ethanol for 10 minutes; repeat in fresh 100% ethanol for an additional 10 minutes.
Immerse the slide in 95% ethanol for 10 minutes.
To permeabilize the tissue section, immerse the slide in 70% ethanol for at least 1 hour at room temperature.
Slides can be stored at +2 to +8 °C in 70% ethanol up to a week before hybridization.
Immerse the slide in 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
Decant PBS, and immerse the slide in pre-warmed (37 °C) proteinase K solution (10 μg/mL proteinase K in 1X PBS).
Incubate for 20 minutes at 37 °C.
Wash with 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
Wash with 1X PBS for 2-5 minutes.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 2 μL of probe stock solution to 200 μL of Hybridization Buffer (enough for one coverslip), and then vortex and centrifuge.
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used on steps 16 and 17.
Immerse the slide-mounted tissue section in Wash Buffer A (see recipe above) for 2-5 minutes.
Assemble humidified chamber: 150 mm tissue culture plate; a single water-saturated paper towel placed alongside the inner chamber edge.
This chamber will help prevent evaporation of the probe solution from the tissue section.
Remove the slide from Wash Buffer A, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Dispense 200 μL of Hybridization Buffer containing probe onto the tissue section of the slide.
(Note that 200 μL is recommended when using a 24 mm x 60 mm, rectangular, #1 coverglass.
If different sized coverglasses are used, the volume may need to be adjusted accordingly).
Carefully place a clean coverglass over the Hybridization Buffer containing probe to completely cover the tissue section, and allow for even distribution of the Hybridization Buffer.
Place the slide in the humidified chamber, cover with the tissue culture lid, and seal with Parafilm®.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for at least 4 hours.
(Incubation can be continued up to 16 hours).
Immerse the slide in Wash Buffer A, and allow the submerged coverglass to slide off the tissue section.
Gentle agitation may be required to remove the coverglass.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant Wash Buffer A, and then add DAPI nuclear stain (Wash Buffer A consisting of 5 ng/mL DAPI) to counterstain the nuclei.
Incubate in the dark at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
Decant DAPI staining buffer, and then immerse slide in Wash Buffer B for 2-5 minutes.
Remove the slide from Wash Buffer B, and carefully wipe away excess buffer surrounding the tissue section.
Add a small drop (approximately 50-100 μL) of Vectashield Mounting Medium onto the tissue section, and cover with a clean #1 coverglass.
Gently squeeze out excess anti-fade from underneath the coverglass.
Seal the coverglass perimeter with clear nail polish, and allow to dry.
Proceed to Imaging.
Preparation of Virus DNA from Seawater for Metagenomics
Precipitate 0.2µm filtered seawater with iron chloride and store the filters at 4°C. 
Resuspend the precipitated virus in Mg-EDTA-Ascorbate (or Oxalate) buffer just prior to DNA extraction (also see Ferric Chloride Resuspension Buffer protocol). 
Treat the resuspended virus preparation with DNase I for 2 hours at room temperature. 
Inactivate the enzyme with EDTA and EGTA.  
Concentrate the resuspended virus preparation using centrifugal concentrators down to 3-5 ml total volume if performing CsCl cleanup or to 1-2 ml total volume if proceeding directly to DNA extraction.  
Remove the concentrate to a fresh tube. 
Rinse the membrane with an additional 0.5-1 ml resuspension buffer by pipetting up and down along the membrane.  
Pool with the concentrated sample.
At this point, either layer this onto premade CsCl gradients and isolate the virus fraction according to the protocol Cesium Chloride Purification of Viruses (or alternatively, Cesium Chloride DNA Extraction of Viruses using Wizard Prep Columns) or proceed directly to Wizard Prep purification of DNA.
Extract the DNA using Wizard Prep columns and resin Calculate the amount of DNA recovered using Quant-iT dsDNA Pico Green assay kit following manufacturer’s directions

Generating viral metagenomes from the coral holobiont
At Trunk Reef, approximately 45 g of coral tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies of Pocillopora damicornis.
Approximately 20 g of Acropora tenuis tissue was sampled from three healthy, freshly collected coral colonies collected in Pioneer Bay.
Fragments were washed in autoclaved, 0.02 μm filtered virus-free seawater.
Subsequently, tissue was blasted from the coral skeleton, using an air-gun, into 15 mL 0.02 μm filtered (Anotop, Whatman) SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in a zip-lock bag.
Briefly, 5 mL of chloroform per 40 mL of coral blastate was added and samples were agitated gently for 1 h at room temperature.
Coral blastates were homogenized at 5000 rpm for 1 min (Heidolph SilentCrusher™).
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min.
The supernatant was transferred to sterile glass corex tubes and spun at 12,000 g for 15 min to pellet the majority of microbial cells (Beckman Coulter JA 25.50 rotor).
A cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient was then formed by layering 1 mL of 1.7, 1.5, and 1.35 g mL−1 CsCl into 13.2 mL UltraClear™ ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter) with 9 mL sample layered on the top of the gradient.
Gradients were then centrifuged for 2 h at 60,000 g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.
In the MECH method, the coral tissue blastate was homogenized at 10,000 rpm for 1 min.
The coral tissue blastate was then spun at 400 g for 5 min.
The supernatant was then aliquoted into 1.5 mL aliquots in 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing 0.3 mL acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter) (Sigma-Aldrich).
The tubes were placed in a bead beater and cells were disrupted at 5000 rpm for 5 min.
Tubes were centrifuged at top speed in a bench-top Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 min.
The supernatant was collected for viral fractionation using step CsCl density gradients.
To confirm that the MECH method was not disrupting virus particles, two dsDNA viruses, OtV-2 (Weynberg et al., 2011) and EhV-86 (Wilson et al., 2005b), were subjected to the same mechanical disruption protocol.
Flow cytometry was used to enumerate viruses before and after disruption.
All samples were treated with DNase and RNase (Ambion) prior to nucleic acid extraction.
DNA was extracted and RNase treated using a MasterPure kit (Epicentre, Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions.
RNA was extracted using a Qiagen QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions, including the final DNase step (Ambion).
Two different amplification methods were used.
In order to reduce some of the inherent biases in multi-displacement amplification (MDA), such as a preference for ssDNA viral genomes, DNA extractions were converted to dsDNA prior to amplification.
Triplicate 10 μ L aliquots of the DNA extractions, containing ds and ssDNA viral genomes, underwent a single round of Klenow reaction (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μ L) by mixing 1.5 μ L of 10× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Buffer 2), 1.5 μ L of dNTPs (2.5 mM stock), 1 μ L of random hexamer primers (50 ng/μ L, Invitrogen).
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μ L of Klenow (3′–5′ exo-) was added and incubated at 25°C for 10 min.
It was then incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
It was then incubated with a termination step of 75°C for 20 min.
After termination, reactions were pooled and cleaned using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit and eluted in 50 μL of Buffer AE.
Replicate MDA reactions (n = 3 for each sample) were amplified using 2.5 μ L dsDNA template and the Qiagen RepliG® kit using the standard protocol.
All reactions were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm amplification, pooled and cleaned with QIAampl DNA minikit and eluted in 200 μ L of Buffer AE.
Negative controls were treated the same and also sent for sequencing to confirm that no viral contamination was present.
As with the RepliG® protocol, Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-) was used to convert all DNA genomes to dsDNA using RP-SISPA primers with a 3′ random hexamer sequence that is used for downstream PCR amplification.
To label the first strand with the RP-SISPA primer, 5 μL of nucleic acid was added to 9 μL reaction mix containing:.
The reaction was incubated at 94°C for 3 min.
The reaction was then placed on ice for 3 min to allow for primer annealing.
1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL, NEB #) was added and incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
A second round of Klenow Fragment reaction (3′–5′ exo) labeled the second strand with the SISPA primer, by adding an additional 1 μL of primer and 1 μL dNTP.
The reaction then underwent a 94°C for 3 min heating step.
The reaction was then put on ice for 3 min.
The reaction then underwent a final addition of 1 μL of Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-).
The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 60 min.
The reaction was then terminated at 75°C for 20 min.
Briefly, in preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 μ L purified RNA viral template was mixed with 1 μ L of 2.5 mM dNTPs and 1.3 μ L of FR26RV-N (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN, 10 μ M stock) and FR40RV-T primer (GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC(T)20, 50 nM stock).
The reaction was heated to 65°C for 5 min.
The reaction was then cooled on ice for 3 min to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, 1 μL DTT (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 1 μL RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample from RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand was synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase.
The reaction was incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min to allow annealing of the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly(T)20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T to the template while cDNA synthesis commenced.
The temperature was then increased to 50°C for 60 min.
The first strand synthesis reaction was heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand was subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 1 μL Klenow Fragment (3′–5′ exo-, 5U/μL).
The Klenow reaction was terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 20 min.
PCR amplification of the SISPA primer labeled template (DNA and RNA) was done in triplicate 25 μL reactions containing:.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 30 cycles of denaturation at:.
The PCR reactions were loaded on to a 0.8% agarose gel in 1×TAE at 100 V for 30 min.
If amplification resulted in visible PCR products (typically a smear; products should be longer than 250 bp), a reconditioning PCR was performed on pooled reactions as follows.
One reconditioning PCR contained 10 μL of pooled SISPA reaction template, 10 μL 10× buffer, 16 μL dNTP (2.5 mM stock), 8 μL FR20RV primer (10 μ M stock) and 0.75 μL TaKaRa LA HS Taq.
The reaction was incubated at 95°C for 10 min.
The reaction then underwent 5 cycles of denaturation at:.
Reactions were cleaned and QC was assessed.
After amplification, samples were cleaned with a QIAamp® DNA Mini kit (RepliG® amplification) or a MinElute® PCR purification kit (RP-SISPA).
Samples were checked for quantification using a Quant-iT PicoGreen® kit on a NanoDrop 3300 fluorospecrometer, for quality (260:280 ratios) on a NanoDrop 2000, and were run on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TAE at 100 V for 30 min to confirm a size range appropriate for sequencing (~250–500 bp) was present without contamination of smaller fragments.
All metagenomes were sequenced using Nextera XT MiSeq 250 bp paired-end sequencing (Illumina) at the Ramaciotti Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.
Raw sequence reads were processed in CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.
Sequences were imported as Illumina paired-end reads, adaptor sequences were trimmed, and reads were checked for quality using a PHRED score of 20 and a minimum length of 100 bp.
Paired reads were merged and a final data set containing merged reads and ORFans was checked again for QC with a minimum length of 200 bp.
To carry out the taxonomic assignment, these non-assembled read data sets were uploaded to the Metavir web server, which is dedicated to the analysis of viral metagenomes (http://metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr) (Roux et al., 2011).
All virus sequences were further classified into families using the taxonomic information from the top BLAST hit.
Tetranucleotide clustering and rarefaction curves were generated using tools available through Metavir.
The five datasets generated from the P. damicornis samples were submitted to Genbank Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and are available under the accession numbers SRR1207981, SRR1207983, SRR1207980, SRR1207984, and SRR1246941 (Table 1 in guidelines).
The two datasets generated from the A. tenuis samples have also been deposited in the SRA under the accession numbers SRR1207979 and SRR1210582.

Building an HPC blast pipeline
Login to the hpc (at the University of Arizona) with your user name Create a directory for the pipeline Go to the hpc-blast directory and create sub directories to hold std-err, std-out, data, blastdb, blast-results and scripts.
Go to the blastdb directory and create the blast database.
Copy the input files over from iPlant.
We will be using the day/night transcriptomes we discussed last week.
You will use two of the Perl scripts from the homework in the hpc pipeline.
Put these into the scripts directory.
config.sh: Now we need to create the config.sh script.
This script will contain all of the environmental variables that the user will be able to modify for running blast.
The idea of this script is to give the user one place to make any changes they need to run their particular blast job.
The user should not have to go in and change any of the scripts in the 'scripts' directory.
Instead, we will capture all of these variable here.
* note the the config.sh script is in the hpc-blast directory (in the first part of the pipeline), where it is easy for the user to modify it.
blast-pipeline.sh:Now we will create the "driver script", the script that is used to run each part of the pipeline.
run-fasta-splitter.sh.
Create a shell script that runs the fasta splitter perl code.
run-blast.sh: Create a shell script that runs blast on a compute node.
run-parse-blast.sh:Create a shell script to parse the blast output that runs on a compute node on the cluster.
04-blast-search.pl: modify the blast search script.Update the e-value to be less stringent.Modify the Perl script 04-blast-search.pl to include additional information about the hit.
Make all of the scripts executable and then run the pipeline.If you don't get any errors, the pipeline will take <1 day to run.
Check to see if the pipeline is running Once the pipeline is finished running (and you don't see the jobs listed under qstat), check for std-errors and std-out.Note you can check while the pipeline is running too.
Now you try.See if you can update the pipeline to add one final step that puts all of the parsed blast output into a single file for each of the original fasta files.Note that you can comment out the parts of the blast-pipeline.sh that you have already run in the steps above, to test your code.
Otherwise, these will run again.Also, before you run this final step, make sure the blast parsing is complete.Can this run on the head node, or should we run this on a compute node?The complete pipeline can be found in github here.
Commit your code to your own github abe487 repository using the directory:hpc-blast

Bacteriophage isolation by spotting on target host cells
The host cells are grown overnight in liquid cultures containing an appropriate growth medium for the organism.
Measure optical density spectrophotometrically at 525 nm (OD525) and adjust OD to 0.3–0.5 with growth medium.
Soft agar (0.5 to 0.6% agar in media of choice) is melted in a water bath or a microwave oven.
Aliquot 4mL of soft agar into sterile tubes and keep just above solidification temperature until use.
200–300 µL bacterial culture is added to the 4 mL tubes with melted soft agar.
The bacteria-soft agar mixture is then vortexed and immediately poured onto an agar plate with an agar that supports growth of the host bacterium.
Distribute bacteria-soft agar mixture evenly on the plate, which is placed on a flat surface.
When the soft agar containing the target bacteria has solidified, triplicate aliquots of 5–10 µL of each of the environmental water samples from which phages should be isolated are spotted on top of the soft agar.
As a negative control 5–10 µL phage buffer (e.g., SM buffer: 450 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris, 0.01 % Gelatin, pH = 8) or 0.02 µm filtered sample water is spotted in triplicate on the soft agar.
The plates are incubated for 1–3 d depending on the growth rate of the bacteria, and the presence of lytic phages in the sample is detected as a clearing zone (plaque) in the spotted area of the lawn of bacteria that develops over time on the plate.
If clearing zones appear in the spotted area, this indicates the presence of lytic phages, which can be isolated and purified Once detected as clearings in the spotting zone, phages are further isolated and purified from the plates.

Place gel with backing plate into receiver in electrophoresis chamber, taking care not to dislodge gel from plate, with wells in rear and let chill.
Transfer aliquots into Microcons (30 or 100 kD MWC).
Place each aliquot in a separate Microcon and spin at 1000 x g for 20 minutes (about 4000 RPM in Eppendorf Microfuge) to near dryness (most of the Microcon membrane is dry, and only a small ring of liquid remains around edge).
As they reach the proper volume, smaller volume aliquots can be removed and stored in the refrigerator until the larger have been reduced to the proper volume.
When all samples have been reduced, add 50 μl 1:10 TE to each tube, taking care not to touch membrane with pipette tip, and spin again to reduce volume as described above.
Repeat step 22.
Repeat step 22 again.

Precision Count Beads™ Protocol and Applications
Perform sample preparation and staining as usual.
Some examples of sample that may be used are:a. Cell lines, b. Whole blood, c. PBMC, d. Cells from migration assays. 
Note: Sample handling such as centrifugation, decanting, or transferring between different tubes can significantly affect cell counts and should be kept to a minimum.
Vigorously vortex the Precision Count Beads™ bottle for 30-40 seconds to ensure complete mixing and break up of aggregates that may occur during storage.
Add 50μl of Precision Count Beads™ per sample.
Accurate pipetting is crucial at this stage.
We recommend using reverse pipetting to ensure pipetting of an accurate amount of beads.
Set up the FSC and SSC channels for the cells of interest as recommended or previously defined, ensuring that the FSC threshold is not too high.
Precision Count Beads™ have a high SSC and low FSC profile.
Thus, SSC should be adjusted in such a way that the cells are optimally visible.
This can be done by acquiring a sample of Precision Count Beads™ alone and compare to the cells profile.
Adjust compensation for the samples if needed Precision Count Beads™ are highly fluorescent in all channels.
Make sure to adjust the voltage to optimally detect the Precision Count Beads™ in at least one fluorescent channel.
Acquire samples on a flow cytometer, gently vortexing every sample prior to acquisition to ensure adequate suspension of the cell and bead populations.
Data analysis should be performed as usual to identify the cell population(s) of interest.
In an ungated plot of the same sample, Precision Count Beads™ can be visualized using one or two fluorescent parameters and a gate set around the bead population.
The bead count and cell count can be obtained using the statistics function from the software.
Absolute counts can then be calculated using formulas provided in the example below.

Equilibrate both tubes from step 11 section I in 43°C water bath/heat block for at least 5 min before use.
After 5 min, prepare 5 plugs from one tube by performing the next steps rapidly to avoid solidification of the cell-agarose mixture before pipeting into plug mold: 
Place plug cast on ice for at least 45min or until agarose has solidified.
Alternatively, can place plug cast on inverted metal microfuge ice block on ice for 45min, to avoid potential contact of agarose with ice.

Protocol for SYBR Counts of Cyanophages and Bacteria
Make dilutions of the sample(s).
Record volume of samples used.
Custom has been to use 20 µl of phage stocks or 200 µl of cells diluted to 2 ml with autoclaved seawater.
If the final slides appear too sparse or dense then the volume of sample used can be adjusted accordingly.
Remove the 10% SYBR and phenylenediamine from the freezer.
Keep the stocks away from light (such as in a drawer) while they are thawing.
Connect the glass flask to the vacuum pump.
Attach the filter holder so that the grout is flat and level with the table.
Place a 0.8 µm filter on top of the grout.
Make sure it is completely flat and centered, with no air bubbles underneath (pre-wetting the grout helps).
This filter can be used many times so long as it stays intact and flat.
Place the 0.02 µm filter on top of the 0.8 µm filter. 
Again, make sure it is flat and centered with no air bubbles underneath.
Turning on the vacuum for a brief while can help achieve this.
Clamp the funnel on top of the filters.
Add the sample and turn on the pump (pressure should be ~20 kPa or 7 mmHg).
After the last liquid passes through the funnel and clamp should be removed with the vacuum still on.
Turn off the vacuum; remove 0.02 µm filter.
Keep track of which side of the filter is the top.
Blot out any seawater on the bottom or the top plastic rim with a kimwipe.
It is very important to make sure the filters are completely dry before continuing.
It is a good idea to rub the back of the filter with a kimwipe and then stick it in a dessicator (we used a makeshift box with some drying rocks) for a few minutes.
Prepare a 100 µL drop of SYBR, made fresh from 2.5 µL 10% stock + 97.5 µL 0.02 µm filtered deionized water, on the bottom of a plastic Petri dish.
Lay the 0.02 Anodisc filters sample side up on the drops of the SYBR staining solution for 15 minutes in a dark drawer or box.
While waiting it may be a good time to prepare the antifade solution.
Dry completely as in steps 7-8.
Do not touch the top of the filter.
Place the filter sample-side up on a glass slide.
Place 30 µL of antifade on a cover slip; then invert slip and place on top of the filter.
Appy pressure to ensure that the antifade fills the space underneath the square.
View with blue excitation.
Examine at least ten fields in the microscope (We usually examine 20).
Count at least 200 viruses or bacteria total for ten fields (400 for 20 fields).
Field size may be full (counting all particles in all 100 small squares) or smaller (e.g. 5 small squares), depending on the virus/bacteria concentration.
Find the average number of particles per quadrant (25 small squares).
Multiply this by a scaling factor of 1.26 x 105 to get the total number of particles on the filter.
Divide this by the volume used (e.g. 20 µL) to get the titer in particles per ml.

Sampling for RNA / Protein/ dissolved nutrients from phage infection experiments
At each time point, collect 10ml from each experimental bottle/tube into a 15ml conical tube, using a serological pipet.
Collect one 10ml sample for RNA and one 10ml sample for protein.
Spin tubes for 15 minutes at 4700 rpm (4816 x g) in a swinging bucket rotor.
If you wish to collect the cell-free fraction (e.g. for analyzing dissolved inorganic or organic nutrients or phage particles): decant supernatants into labeled sterile 50 ml conical tubes.
We pool the RNA and protein supernatants together resulting in a 20ml combined supernatant.
If you do not wish to collect the cell-free fraction: decant supernatant into waste container.
Flash-freeze cell pellets in 15 ml tubes using liquid nitrogen; store pellets in -80°C freezer until later analysis.
If you are not collecting the cell-free fraction, stop here.
If you are collecting the cell-free fraction, go to Step 5.
Remove the plunger from a 20ml clean syringe.
Attach a new 0.2µm syringe filter to the syringe.
Pour your 20ml combined supernatant into the barrel of the syringe.
Replace plunger on the syringe and filter your 20ml supernatant into appropriate tubes for your downstream nutrient/phage analysis (we use a 15ml conical tube plus a 5ml snap-cap Eppendorf tube).
Repeat step 5 for each sample.
You can reuse the same syringe for replicates of the same condition/treatment.
Store 0.2µm filtered samples in -20ºC until analysis.
(if analyzing phage particles in the filtrate, store at 4ºC instead.)
Optiprep gradient preparation for virus separation
Optiprep preparation UV and sterilize class II cabinet with reagent alcohol.
Work with gloves and sleeve guards to prevent contaminating the hood.
Label 5 15ml falcon tubes with 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% and 45% labels.
Label a 50 ml falcon tube "Optiprep".
Remove OptiPrep solution from the fridge and wipe down sides, cap and septum with alcohol.
Pierce septum with needle (20 gauge 1/2 inch needles work best) attached to appropriately-sized syringe and aseptically remove 15-16 ml of OptiPrep for every 2 gradients you intend to make.
Place Optiprep in the sterile 50 ml falcon tube.
Make 25%, 30%, 35%, 40% and 45% Optiprep solutions in the labeled falcon tubes.
You will need 2.5 ml of each solution for every gradient you plan to make.
Mix well.
For example, if you are making 2 gradients, you will prepare 5 ml of each solution as follows: 25% = 3 ml media + 2 ml Optiprep30% = 2.5 ml media + 2.5 ml OptiPrep35% = 2.1 ml media + 2.9 ml OptiPrep40% = 1.7 ml media + 3.3 ml OptiPrep45% = 1.25 ml media + 3.75 ml OptiPrep. 
Make a loading system for the centrifuge tubes by attaching the thin end of a pasteur pipet to a 5 ml syringe with parafilm or a rubber tube.
Hold the syringe with a ring clamp so that the end of the Pasteur pipet tip hovers just above the bottom of the tube.
Pipette 2.4 ml of 25% solution into the syringe.
It will begin to flow into the centrifuge tube via gravity.
When nearly all the solution has left the syringe, add 2.4 ml of the 30%.
Repeat for all solutions.
NOTE: Try not to let the syringe run dry as it will introduce air bubbles into the tube and disrupting the reagent.
If this happens, you can restart the flow by placing your thumb on the top of the syringe to generate and seal and then move your thumb up and down to increase the pressure in the syringe.
Once all tube has been poured (all percent solutions have been added), seal the top with parafilm and place the tubes in the fridge.
Allow the tubes to sit overnight to form a continuous gradient.
NOTE:  Tubes may sit in the fridge for several weeks and will still be good as long as they are sealed.
Separating viruses on the Optiprep gradient.
The next morning, pipette 0.5 - 4 ml of your viral concentrate onto each gradient.
Balance the tubes using sterile growth medium if necessary (or whatever solution the virus sample is suspended in).
Centrifuge the tubes in a swinging bucket rotor in the Beckman Advanti J30-I (use rotor JS-25.15) at max speed (40,000 rpm) for at least 4 hours at 8˚C.
NOTE: Occasionally you will need to spin for longer than 4 hours to achieve separation.
In these cases an overnight or 24 hour spin may be required.
Remove the tubes carefully out of the rotor and place them on a standing clamp to visualize the bands.
NOTE:  Sometimes the bands are not visible until you suspend the tubes in a beaker of water, remove and back light them.
Extracting bands.
Extract the bands separately using sterile needles and a 3 ml syringe.
NOTE: You must use 20 gauge half-inch needles at this stage to avoid puncturing both walls of the tube!
Do not use any needles longer than ½”.
Wipe the sides of the tube wall with ethanol.
Place the syringe just below the band and puncture the wall.
Aspirate and remove the band with the syringe until the band disappears.
It usually results in about 400 ul – 1 ml volume removed.
Place a piece of scotch tape over the hole in the tube to prevent the gradient from leaking out.
Place the sample into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and store at 4˚C until ready to use.
NOTE: If you have multiple bands, extract in the order from lowest to highest.
This will prevent any leakage from the puncture site from possibly contaminating the wall next to your lower bands.

One-step Phage Infection of Cyanobacteria (large-scale)
Before T0, use flow cytometry to measure cell concentrations of cyanobacterial cultures from Step 2.
Use SYBR staining (e.g. SYBR counts of viruses) to determine concentration of your concentrated viral lysate from Step 1.
Calculate volumes of cells, phage and media to add to each experimental bottle/tube.
We have an Excel template to do this calculation, based on the desired MOI, cell concentration, and final experimental culture volume.
For gene expression experiments, we use an MOI of 3, final cell density of 5e7/ml, and volume of 200ml for each replicate -- this scale allows us to sample for RNA, protein, and phage & cell concentration, over a 12-14 hour time course.
Working quickly, and with sterile technique, initialize experiment by mixing volumes (calculated in Step 3) of media, cells, and phage.
First add appropriate volume of sterile medium to your experimental culture vessel (e.g. sterile 250ml polycarbonate bottles for 200ml cultures).
Then add cells (prepared in Step 2).
Then, to uninfected control bottles, add lysate that has been filtered to remove phage particles (e.g. the filtrate that goes through an Amicon centrifugal device).
[This is important to control for small molecules that may be added with the phage particles in infected treatments; however keep in mind that other large molecules will get retained, along with phage particles, in the Amicon reservoir.]
Finally, just before T0, add phage to their respective bottles.
This begins the one-step infection.
Mix bottles by gentle vortexing.
Sample immediately for time 0.
Suggested sampling: FCM for cell counts, Fluorescence, extracellular phage, RNA-protein.
Place bottles in incubator until next time point.
Repeat sampling in Step 5 at each time point (e.g. every 1-2 hours) until lysis is complete.
Prepare cells for infection: Grow up sufficiently large volumes of cells to be infected.
Plan carefully so that cells are in mid-log phase on the day of the experiment.
If you are growing volumes of 1L or more, bubble your culture with an aquarium pump (ambient air) connected to a diffuser stone, to prevent CO2 limitation.
Prepare phage stockGrow: On day minus-8, add phage stock to 4L of mid-log cells to start the infection (a low MOI is sufficient, e.g. 0.01-0.05), and monitor for about a week until the culture clears.
Harvest: When the culture has cleared (i.e. most cells have lysed), centrifuge the cleared culture (max speed, 10 min) to remove large cell debris and unlysed cells.
Pour supernatant (containing phage) into disposable sterile vacuum filtration units containing a 0.2µm PES filter; discard the pellet containing cell debris.
Connect to vacuum source and filter the lysate; save filtrate containing your phage particles.
Concentrate: Concentrate this clarified phage lysate using VivaFlow Concentration of Phage Lysate.
Further concentrate the phage stock, and exchange buffers/media if necessary (e.g. to remove P, N, or other nutrients in the initial lysate) using Amicon Concentration of Viruses.

Nutrient deplete/replete algal culture for elemental analysis
Culture Preparation/GrowthComparative measurements depend on having well-characterized culture growth.
Initiate an experimental culture to allow for at least 7 generations of characterized exponential growth (10 generations is the gold standard) prior to centrifugation and resuspension.
Monitor growth daily, including transfer/dilution to pre-determined mid-exponential density (i.e., semi-continuous culture) until target biomass is reached.
A safe estimate for the target biomass is to assume ~10% recovery of cells after centrifugation and washing (this is strain dependent).
Ensure cell density remains within the exponential range by increasing culture volume (not cell density) when ramping up to target biomass.
Example Ostreococcus lucimarinus (CCMP2972A) culture preparation:
Growth conditions: 18°C, 14:10 hour light:dark cycle, light irradiance of ~100 µE m-2 s-1.

NOTE: Extra-large volumes used for omics experiment Concentration and Resuspension.
When target culture biomass has been reached, split volume evenly among 2 or 4 acid-cleaned and autoclaved centrifuge bottles.
Weigh and balance bottles by removing volume until bottle pairs are within 0.01 g of each other.
Only open bottles in hood to maintain axenicity!
Carry bottles over to Sorvall RC 26 Plus centrifuge.
Fit centrifuge with large rotor (accomodates 4 centrifuge bottles).
Make sure pins are offset when rotor is placed into the centrifuge.
Place paired bottles opposite of each other in the rotor and tighten the lid.
Spin at the following settings: Rotor = GS-3 (choose option code “03”), Speed = 7300 RPM (equivalent to 10,000 rcf with this large rotor), Time = 0:32 minutes (includes 2 minute ramp up), *strain specificTemp = +20/+25°C, (will try to maintain lower temp, and shut down at max temp).
After the spin, carefully transport the bottles back to hood, taking care not to resuspend the cell pellets/smears.
Gently pour off the supernatant into a waste container, trying to disturb the cell smear as little as possible.
Resuspend/wash cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium equivalent to the initial culture volume in each bottle.
Repeat 2-8.Resuspend cells with a volume of nutrient deplete medium that is ~5% of the initial culture volume in each bottle.
Run a sample of the cell concentrate in the Accuri to determine density.
Store cells at normal growth conditions during Accuri run and calculations.
Experimental Culture Initiation.
Calculate appropriate volume based on Accuri measurement to inoculate experimental nutrient replete and deplete culture flasks from the cell concentrate at a starting density corresponding to early-exponential growth.
NOTE: It helps to have some amount of media pre-aliquoted to experimental flasks.
Adjust as needed to achieve target density and volume.
Once all experimental cultures have been inoculated, mix and sample for FCM and Accuri measurements to monitor growth daily.
When the average daily growth rate of the nutrient deplete cultures (GRDEP), is reduced to half or less of the growth rate of the replete cultures (GRDEP/GRREP < 0.5), collect samples for FCM (i.e., cell counts) and elemental analyses (i.e., particulate carbon/nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as dissolved nutrients).

General protocol for the concentration of virioplankton from a large volume (>20 L) water sample
Prefilter ambient water sample with a 25-µm wound polypropylene sediment filter before any concentration using a peristaltic or diaphragm pump.
Rinse the concentration container three times with prefiltered water before filling with prefiltered sample water.
Once the concentration container is full of 25 µm prefiltered ambient water, arrange the tubing for tangential flow filtration (TFF).
Attach the 0.22-µm tangential flow filtration (TFF) filter feed and retentate tubing to the TFF filter housing inlet and outlet ports, respectively.
Attach the permeate tubing to the permeate port of the TFF filter housing and direct into a separate container to catch virus-containing water.
Run the feed tubing through a large peristaltic pump head.
If the peristaltic pump head has an occlusion setting, set it to maximal occlusion to help prime the 0.22-µm TFF filter and remove all air.
Turn the peristatic pump on and increase the peristaltic pump speed to 20% to prime the tubing and remove excess air.
Once the tubing and filter are completely filled with water, adjust the occlusion knob to a looser setting to prevent excessive tubing wear.
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45%.
Once the system is running smoothly, partially open the permeate valve on the 0.22-µm TFF filter to the second tick mark (~20° open).
Collect the <0.22 µm permeate into an appropriately sized carboy.
When the permeate carboy is more than half full with <0.22 µm permeate, prepare the 30-kD TFF filter for viral concentration.
Slow the large peristaltic pump speed to 10%.
Attach the feed and retentate tubing to the appropriate ports on the 30-kD TFF.
Direct the permeate tubing from the 30-kD TFF filter into a clean carboy to collect ultrafiltrate (UF; virus-free water).
Carefully work the feed tubing into the second pump head of the large peristaltic pump.
Increase the large peristaltic pump speed to 20%.
Again, tighten the occlusion knob on the pump head to prime the 30-kD TFF filter and remove all air.
Once the filter and lines are fully primed loosen the pump head occlusion knob.
Slowly increase the pump speed to 45%.
Slowly close the backpressure knob on the 30-kD TFF filter until permeate begins to flow.
Monitor the level of <0.22 µm water in the <0.22 µm permeate carboy.
The level should be maintained at half full until the pre filtered ambient water is nearly gone.
Collect 1 L of ultra filtrate (30 kD TFF permeate) in a 2-L bottle for rinsing of the 30-kD TFF filter.
When ~5 L of 25 µm filtered ambient water remains in the large carboy, release the pump head and remove the 0.22-µm TFF filter feed tubing from the large peristaltic pump.
Continue to run the 30-kD TFF filter until ~1 L of <0.22 µm water remains in the carboy.
When 1L or less of <0.22 µm water remains, stop the large peristaltic pump and drain the 30-kD TFF filter into the <0.22 µm water carboy.
Slowly prime the 30-kD TFF filter from the 1 L of collected UF from step 22 and then recirculate (feed, retentate and permeate lines of the 30-kD filter in the 1L of UF) the UF at 30% pump speed for 5 min.
Stop the pump, release the pump head, and drain all tubing into the 2-L UF bottle.
Pool the recirculated UF with the ~1 L of retentate from the primary viral concentration through the 30-kD TFF filter.
The volume of the ~2 L viral concentrate can be further reduced by using a small-scale TFF ultrafilter.
To avoid excessive degradation of viruses, it is advisable to store the first stage VC at 4°C and perform a second stage small-scale concentration a soon as possible (i.e., within no more than 1 d).
Insure that the permeate port is closed, then begin priming the system as follows.

Quick Protocol for Monarch® DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020)
Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel, taking care to trim excess agarose.
Transfer to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and weigh the gel slice.
Minimize exposure to UV light.
Add 4 volumes of Gel Dissolving Buffer to the gel slice (e.g., 400 μl buffer per 100 μl or 100 mg agarose).
Incubate the sample between 37–55°C (typically 50°C), until the gel slice is completely dissolved (generally 5–10 minutes).
The time that takes a gel slice to melt depends on the size of the slice, the temperature used in the incubation as well as the percent agarose used in the gel.

Dimethylglyoxime reagent for cobalt analyses
Dissolve 0.2232 g of EDTA into 600 mL of Milli-Q for a final concentration of 10-3 mol L-1 EDTA.
Weigh out approximately 1.2 g of DMG (dimethylglyoxime) onto a weigh boat, and combine it into the EDTA solution.
Weigh what is left on the weigh boat (DMG is very sticky so not all of it will pour into the EDTA solution) and record the final weight that was placed into the EDTA solution.
Heat this solution in a microwave at 50% power until the DMG is fully dissolved, stirring it carefully in between microwaving, and trying to prevent it from boiling.
This takes up to 30 minutes, so be patient and heat it slowly and carefully.
Put the solution on ice and let it recrystallize overnight in a refrigerator.
After it has recrystallized, pour off (or slowly pipette off) the supernatant until there is as little liquid as possible.
Then pour the remaining crystals into a clean, dry weigh boat (that you have weighed and noted the weight for later use) and let the remaining liquid evaporate overnight inside a laminar flow hood.
After all the liquid has evaporated, measure the weight boat again to get an approximate measurement of the amount of DMG you have recrystallized.
Calculate how much methanol is needed to add to the DMG in order to get a final concentration of 0.1 mol L-1 DMG, and obtain a trace metal clean bottle of the appropriate size.
Weigh the clean bottle, and then carefully transfer the recrystallized DMG into this clean bottle and re-weigh (not all the DMG is easily transferred into the clean bottle, so the re-weigh is necessary).
Now recalculate the amount of optima methanol needed to get the desired concentration of 0.1 mol L-1, and add that amount of optima methanol.
Make sure to test the reagent before use.

Tube-O-Dialyzer (No Loss Dialyzer for Small Samples)
Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ are supplied in a preservative to maintain quality.
Prior to use discard the preservative from the tube and place the dialysis cap upside down in a beaker or other suitable container.
Pipette your sample directly into the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
For Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Micro use 20‐250µl and for Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Medi use 0.2‐2.5ml.
Remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ dialysis cap from the rinse water/buffer and carefully remove excess liquid with a pipette tip.
Screw the dialysis cap on to the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube until finger tight.
Invert the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, ensuring the entire sample rests upon the membrane.
Keeping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in an inverted position, slide the supplied float onto the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
Place the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in the dialysis buffer.
Ensure that the dialysis membrane contacts the dialysis buffer.
If there are large air bubbles trapped underneath the dialysis membrane surface, tilt the tube or squirt buffer to remove the air bubbles.
Dialysis Time:  Dialysis time will depend on the nature of sample, MWCO of the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, sample and dialysis buffer volume and concentration.
Higher MWCO will allow faster dialysis.
As a guide, the sample should be dialyzed for 2‐12h.
Dialysis buffer should also be replaced at least once during dialysis.
After dialysis, remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ from the float and immediately spin the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ (in up‐right position) for 5‐6 seconds at 500‐1,000xg.
Discard the dialysis cap and replace with the supplied Storage Cap.
Add 1‐2ml DI water or dialysis buffer to rinse.
Keep the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ membrane wet until required.
Gently, stir the dialysis buffer.
For efficient and complete dialysis we recommend inverting or gently tapping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ 1‐2 times during dialysis to mix the sample.

Basic Illumina Sequence Quality Control
Assess raw FASTQ sequences using the program FastQCGoal.
Remove low quality sequences to increase average quality score of reads above 28 For current sequencing centers, the 5' end of has had Illumina adapters and primers removed.
But there can be inclusion of the 3' end Illumina adapter in DNA fragments with length less than the number of the cycles for the sequencer.
Remove Illumina adaptor sequences from 3' end of sequences - be sure to preserve reads of 0 length.
Repeat step for all raw read files.
Assess Cutadapt results with FastQC.
Remove low quality base pairs from sequences, generally from the 3' end, using a sliding window of 10 bp that will trim all trailing bases if the average quality score drops below 28.
Important: To maintain the order of paired-end Illumina sequences both reads must be input simultaneously with the same number of sequences submitted from each read pair, regardless of the length of the sequence.
Assess file quality scores using FastQC.
Utilize Trimmomatic for any other issues - such as poor quality in the first bp, etc.

Grind and sterilise the spore heads: Get ready: At the flow hood.
Prepare eppendorf tubes, and 3 x 50mL falcon tubes: 1) for sterile water, 2) for Milton solution (1 Milton tablet in 25ml sterile water), and 3) for the washed spores heads.
Use two sporangia per transformation.
Check number of sporangia in the spore head (this is variable, ex there may be only 1 sporangia in one spore head, and 5 sporangia in another spore head).
Add the spores heads to an eppendorf tube.
Depending on final number of spore heads needed, you may need to divide them into several eppendorfs tubes.
Add 0.5ml Milton solution to each eppendorf tube.
Use a plastic pestle to crush the sporangia and vortex them until completely re-suspended.
Filter crushed spore heads: Place the 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml falcon tube.
Pour onto the filter the solution with ground sporangia from all eppendorfs, pour the 0.5 ml from each eppendorf.
The solution with spores will flush through the cell strainer.
Rinse the Eppendorf(s) and strainer with 0.5 ml of Milton solution for each two sporangia used (ex. 3 ml for 12 sporangia).
Aliquot the solution with spores in eppendorf tubes (0.5 or 1ml per tube), let them sit for 5 minutes and spin for 6-7 minutes at 13000rpm.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores in each tube with 150 μl of sterile water.  
Plate spores: Plate the 150 μl of re-suspended spores on a 1/2 GB plate (no antibiotics).
Use an L-shaped spreader.
If 0.5 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 2 sporangia), use one plate per transformation.
If 1 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 4 sporangia), use half a plate per transformation.
Grow upside down (rhizoids will grow away from the media) for 5-6 days at 21 ºC CL 150μE Sporelings (germinated spores) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days. 
Agro transformation: Mix DNA and Agro: For each agro transformation, add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 μL of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (kept on ice).
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse.
Recover Agro: Immediately add 1mL of SOC (or LB) and incubate 1-2h at 28 ºC 150 rpm.
Plate Agro: Streak 20-50μL on LB plates + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5, for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid).
Each Agro transformation in a different plate.
Grow for 3 days at 28 ºC or 30 ºC, incubator. 
Optional Agro colony PCR: all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive, however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate.
In that case, do a colony PCR of Agro colonies.
Grow Agro culture:   (~ 15'' – set up sometime in the afternoon).
For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate, inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid) in a 15 ml falcon tube (unskirted tube).
Incubate at 28 ºC - 150 rpm (wrap the tubes in foil) and let grow for 1.5 days.  
Agro induction with Acetosyringone: (~20'' plus 6 h induction – set up in the morning): Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture(s) 10'' at 3000g.
For each agrobacterium culture, discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 μM Acetosyringone.
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 μM (for 3ml media add 3 μl 100 mM stock solution).
Shake for 6 h at 28 ºC at 150 rpm in the dark (wrap the tubes in foil).
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings.
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader, gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask.
Use one plate per flask (transformation) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate, or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate.
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone, for a final concentration of 100μM.
To each flask, add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture (induced 6 h prior).
Co-cultivate for 2 days (at least 36 h or 1.5 days) on a shaker in the tissue culture room (21 ºC, CL 150-200 uE) Sporelings Collection.
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml, 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), collect the sporelings  by pouring the flask contents in a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle.
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates (1/2 GB plates with antibiotics), make sure they are well spread, the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow.   
Screening for transformants: Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die.
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating.
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 days.
Once positive transformants have grown, from about a week and a half onwards, they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics, so they can grow faster and make gemmae

Western Blot
Place gels in the Bio-Rad gel running apparatus and make sure they are locked into place, then pour 1x Protein Running Buffer inbetween the two gels until it's about 25% full to ensure there are no leaks.
After no leaks have been found, fill the middle up the rest of the way up so it covers the top of the wells and pour 1x Protein Running Buffer outside of the gels so it covers the bottom of the glass.
Remove the combs from each gel and wash lanes a few times with 1x Protein Running Buffer, then load your samples and ladder.
In any unused wells, fill them up with a similar volume that you loaded your samples with of 1x Protein Running Buffer.
Run 10% gels at 150 volts until the ladder reaches the bottom of the glass.
Cut nitrocellulose membrane and pieces of filter paper to the same size as the gel, and cut one corner so you are able to orient yourself to which side is the front or back, then soak in 100% methanol, followed by quickly submerging in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes.
Pour out 1x Protein Running Buffer (can reuse 1 time) into a bottle and then remove the gels from the gel apparatus.
Separate the glass pieces, remove the gel, cut off and discard the stacking portion, and submerge the separating portion in 1x Transfer Buffer for at least 15 minutes. 
Pour 1x Transfer Buffer into Bio-Rad transfer apparatus and soak both sponges and filter paper in the buffer.
Open up plastic sandwich, and starting with the clear side:
Place a wet sponge down.
Place a wet piece of filter paper.
Place the nitrocellulose membrane onto the filter paper (down in the middle first then let each side down so you have no air bubbles).
Place the gel on the same way.
Place the other piece of filter paper down the same way.  
Use a 15 mL centrifuge tube and roll from one side of the sandwich to the other to ensure there are no air bubbles.
Place the other sponge on top, then fold the black side up and lock the clear and black sides together so there is a complete sandwich, and load it into the center of the transfer apparatus, so that the black side of the sandwich matches the black side of the sandwich holder, and the clear side is closer to the red side of the sandwich holder.
Load the ice block into the apparatus then fill the Bio-Rad container to the top with chilled 1x Transfer Buffer.
Add the lid to the container, plug it into the amplifier, and perform the transfer at room temperature at 50 volts for two hours.
Remove membrane from sandwich, rinse with water, and submerge in TBST + 5% Milk with shaking for two hours to initiate blocking.
Dump the TBST + Milk, then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5% Milk and 1 uL Primary Antibody (all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it) and let it rock at 4 C from two hours to overnight.
Pour off TBST and 5% Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature.
Dump the TBST, then add 10 mL of fresh TBST + 5% Milk and 1 uL Secondary Antibody (all mixed together before submerging the membrane in it) and let it incubate while shaking at room temperature for 1 hour.
Pour off TBST and 5% Milk with the Antibody and do five 10 minute washes with TBST and shaking at room temperature.
Add just enough BCIP/NBT to cover the membrane and let it shake at room temperature until bands develop.
Adsorbing Viruses on TEM Grids
On the same day as grid prep, use glow discharge to render grids hydrophylic.
Holding the grid in the tweezers, place 5 µl of viral lysate onto the shiny side of the grid (Figure 1).
Let the sample sit for ~3 minutes to allow the viruses to adsorb to the grid.
Stain the viruses using the protocol “Positive and Negative Staining of Viruses on TEM Grids”.
PhosphoThreonine Western Blotting
Run 40% of IP eluate on 10% gel Tris-Glycine. 
Transfer protein to PVDF membrane for 1hr at RT with ice pack (100V). 
Cut membrane just below 180kD (top MW marker on benchmark prestained ladder). 
Cut Membrane at ~82kD (the blue band above the pink band using benchmark prestained ladder).
**Note, the GST-tagged protein is ~115 kD.
Cutting the membrane in the places will help reduce non-specific binding.
Also, running a ladder in the middle of the gel will help you cut straight across the membrane in the event that the gel is transferred at an angle relative to the membrane.
Block membrane with 5% BSA (IgG and Protease-Free)/TBST for 2hrs at RT. 
Probe membrane with phospho-threonine-HRP antibody in IgG-Free/Protease-Free BSA/TBST (1:1000).
Probe overnight at 4C in cold room on tilting tray.
Rinse membrane 8x over the course of 2hrs with 1x TBST. 
Activate membrane with pico ECL.
**Note, the anti-pThr antibody is HRP conjugated so you don't need to use a secondary.

Wait for 1 minute, then spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g to elute the DNA.
Nuclease-free water (pH 7–8.5) can also be used to elute the DNA.
Plaque Assay Protocol for Pseudoalteromonas
First, autoclave the top agar to melt it.
While the autoclave is running, let your bottom agar plates warm to room temperature and label them and make whatever dilutions of your phages you plan to plate.
Note:  it is wise to plate one dilution higher and one dilution lower than what you calculated as optimal. 
Aliquot the agar into tubes and place in 40°C water bath.
Pipet 100 μl of your phage sample onto the plate.   
Remove the agar tube from the water bath and add the host to it using a 1 ml or 5 ml pipettor. 
Add 3.5 ml of the agar/host mixture to each plate.
Swirl the plate to spread the agar making sure it covers the whole plate.
Leave the plates on the bench overnight. 
Count or pick plaques the next day

Fingerprinting aquatic virus communities using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Prepare the 1.5% agarose and the lysis buffer.
Incubate the agarose at 80°C until further use.
Dispense 5 mL of the freshly made lysis buffer into 50-mL Falcon tubes, one for each sample.
Combine equal volumes (200 µL) of virus concentrate and molten 1.5% agarose.
Mix briefly.
Dispense the mixture into plug molds with a pipette.
Place the plug molds in the freezer (–20°C) for at least 2 min to set.
Remove the tape from the bottom of the plug molds and push the plugs out from the molds into 5 mL lysis buffer.
Incubate the plugs in lysis buffer overnight in the dark at 30°C.
The next day, decant the lysis buffer using a plastic sieve (screened cap) that can be attached at the top of the Falcon tube.
Wash the plugs three times, 30 min each, in TE buffer 10:1 at room temperature.
The plugs can be stored at 4°C in TE 20:50 for several month before further processing; nevertheless, we recommend running the samples as soon as possible, because degradation of the viral DNA will occur and result in less discrete bands.
Set up the gel rig.
Prepare a 1% agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer.
Melt until the agarose is completely dissolved.
Place the warm agarose at 60°C for 10 min before pouring into the gel rig and allowing it to cool.
Keep ~5 mL agarose at 60°C for later use to seal the wells.
When the agarose is set, pour 50 mL of 1× TBE running buffer on the top of the gel and place it in the refrigerator for at least 20 min or overnight.
Place molecular weight standards (slices of ~5 mm) on either side of the gel.
Place the samples between the markers using a sterile loop.
Overlay the wells with leftover molten 1% agarose.
Remove the gel from the pouring rig and remove any extraneous agarose from the bottom and edges.
Prepare the 1× TBE (running buffer) and place at 14°C until further use.
Place the gel into the electrophoresis chamber and carefully pour the cooled 1× TBE running buffer into the chamber.
Run the gel at 6 V cm–1 with pulse ramps from 20 to 40 s (for example) at 14°C for 22 h. To separate different viral genome size classes, each sample could be run three times:.
