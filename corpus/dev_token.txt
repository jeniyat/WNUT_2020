Heat to dissolve.
Autoclave to sterilize.
Pour into medium sized petri dishes.
When the agar plates are cooled and set, streak some liquid from a bacterized culture of the protist on the agar plates.
Incubate the agar plates at the same conditions of the protist culture
When bacteria colonies form, use a flame sterilized metal loop to pick one clonal strain and dip the metal loop into a nutrient broth (0.5% yeast extract + 0.5% trypton in MQ/FSW).
Let the bacteria grow in the same incubating conditions.
Grow a large amount of the bacteria.
Prepare 1 L of bacteria nutrient broth (Or however much depending on how much bacteria you want to grow)0.5% yeast extract + 0.5% trypton in MQ or FSW and autoclave to sterilize.
Transfer 0.1 ml of the bacteria culture into the broth.
Let the bacteria grow for ~4 days.

Agrobacterium mediated transformation of Marchantia spores
Grind and sterilise the spore heads: 
Get ready: At the flow hood.
Prepare eppendorf tubes, and 3 x 50mL falcon tubes: 1) for sterile water, 2) for Milton solution (1 Milton tablet in 25ml sterile water), and 3) for the washed spores heads.
Use two sporangia per transformation.
Check number of sporangia in the spore head (this is variable, ex there may be only 1 sporangia in one spore head, and 5 sporangia in another spore head).
Add the spores heads to an eppendorf tube.
Depending on final number of spore heads needed, you may need to divide them into several eppendorfs tubes.
Add 0.5ml Milton solution to each eppendorf tube.
Use a plastic pestle to crush the sporangia and vortex them until completely re-suspended.
Filter crushed spore heads:
Place the 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 ml falcon tube.
Pour onto the filter the solution with ground sporangia from all eppendfors, pour the 0.5 ml from each eppendorf.
The solution with spores will flush through the cell strainer.
Rinse the Eppendorf(s) and strainer with 0.5 ml of Milton solution for each two sporangia used (ex. 3 ml for 12 sporangia).
Aliquot the solution with spores in eppendorf tubes (0.5 or 1ml per tube), let them sit for 5 minutes and spin for 6-7 minutes at 13000rpm.
Discard the supernatant and resuspend the spores in each tube with 150 μl of sterile water.  
Plate spores: Plate the 150 μl of re-suspended spores on a 1/2 GB plate (no antibiotics).
Use an L-shaped spreader.
If 0.5 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 2 sporangia), use one plate per transformation.
If 1 ml aliquots made (equivalent to 4 sporangia), use half a plate per transformation.
Grow upside down (rhizoids will grow away from the media) for 5-6 days at 21 ºC CL 150μE Sporelings (germinated spores) have red fluoresence from chlorophyll autofluorescence after ~ 3 days. 
Agro transformation: 
Mix DNA and Agro: For each agro transformation, add 20-50ng of plasmid to 50 μL of thawed electrocompetent Agrobacterium cells (kept on ice).
Electroporate in a chilled 2 mm cuvette with a 2.5 kV pulse.
Recover Agro: Immediately add 1mL of SOC (or LB) and incubate 1-2h at 28 ºC 150 rpm.
Plate Agro: Streak 20-50μL on LB plates + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5, for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid).
Each Agro transformation in a different plate.
Grow for 3 days at 28 ºC or 30 ºC, incubator. 
Optional Agro colony PCR: all agrobacterium colonies on LB + antibiotics plates should be positive, however if there are some issues with the transformations it may be useful to do a quick screen to check if there are any false positives on the plate.
In that case, do a colony PCR of Agro colonies.
Grow Agro culture:   (~ 15'' – set up sometime in the afternoon) For each Agro transformation pick a single colony from plate, inoculate 5 ml LB media + antibiotics (Kan 50, Tet 5 for GV2260 with a pGreen plasmid) in a 15 ml falcon tube (unskirted tube).
Incubate at 28 ºC - 150 rpm (wrap the tubes in foil) and let grow for 1.5 days.  
Agro induction with Acetosyringone: (~20'' plus 6 h induction – set up in the morning): Centrifuge the agrobacterium culture(s) 10'' at 3000g.
For each agrobacterium culture, discard the supernatant and re-suspend in 3 ml of 1/2 GB media sup containing 100 μM Acetosyringone.
Add acetosyringone to a final concentration of 100 μM (for 3ml media add 3 μl 100 mM stock solution).
Shake for 6 h at 28 ºC at 150 rpm in the dark (wrap the tubes in foil).
Agro co-Cultivation with sporelings.
Scrape the 6 days old sporelings from the plate using an L shaped spreader, gather the sporelings and move them into a 100-250 ml autoclaved flask.
Use one plate per flask (transformation) if you plated 2 sporangia per plate, or half a plate if you plated 4 sporangia per plate.
Add to each flask 25 ml of 1/2 GB media sup and 25 ul of 100mM Acetosyringone, for a final concentration of 100μM.
To each flask, add 1ml of the appropiate Agrobacterium culture (induced 6 h prior).
Co-cultivate for 2 days (at least 36 h or 1.5 days) on a shaker in the tissue culture room (21 ºC, CL 150-200 uE) Sporelings Collection.
Add cefotaxime 100mg/ml stock solution to sterile water for a final concentration of 100ug/ml, 150-200 ml are needed per flask of co-cultivation.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), collect the sporelings  by pouring the flask contents in a 70 μm cell strainer placed on a 1L bottle.
Rinse the sporeling by pouring over them 150-200ml of water + cefo 100 Sporelings plating.
For each co-cultivation flask (transformation), with the help of a tip and a few ml of water + cefo remove the sporelings from the cell strainer and spread them on at least 3 plates (1/2 GB plates with antibiotics), make sure they are well spread, the better the spread the better the transgenic plants will grow.   
Screening for transformants: Positive transformants grow while non-trasnformed sporelings die.
Positive transformants become evident from about 1 week after plating.
Positive transformants with a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA can start to be screened under the microscope after about 5 daysOnce positive transformants have grown, from about a week and a half onwards, they should be transferred to new 1/2 GB plates with antibiotics, so they can grow faster and make gemmae

One-step growth curves for Cellulophaga phages
Inoculate a new culture; ie, pick a colony into a new flask containing 10 ml of MLB media. 
Immediately after the transfer, take a ‘time 0’ growth reading (T0).
Continue taking readings as performed in step 2 periodically.
Do a plaque assay to determine the PFU/ml of the lysate you plan to use.
Calculate the volume needed for 107 phages.
Determine the concentration of your culture at the time you start the infection.
Calculate the volume of host culture needed for 108 cells.
Pipet this amount into a 1.5 ml tube.
Add 107 phages to the tube and start your timer for 15 minutes to allow the phages to adsorb to the host cells.
After 15 minutes, dilute the infection 1:1000 in MLB media in a 250 ml flask.

Isolation of cyanophages by plaque assays
Prepare base plates Prepare top agar/agarose.
Prepare target indicator cells.
Prepare the sample: Environmental samples should be prefiltered as described earlier.
Adsorb 50 to 100 µL sample (as is, and 10-fold serial dilutions, up to ca. 3 levels) to 0.5 mL target cells under the usual culturing conditions (e.g., for Synechococcus sp. strain DC2, constant 5–25 µmol quanta m–2s–1, at 25°C), agitate occasionally to encourage adsorption of phage to host.
After 1 h, transfer virus: host mixture to 2.5 mL soft agar.
Quickly and gently vortex the mixture and pour the entire tube contents onto the surface of the agar plate.
Working rapidly, gently rock and swirl the plate to spread the mixture evenly onto the plate surface before the agar starts to gel.
Set aside on a flat surface to harden (about 1 h).
Prepare a control plate containing only cells; this plate will allow you to monitor cell growth.
Seal plate with parafilm, flip plates upside down.
Incubation of plates under constant low light conditions (5 to 25 µmol quanta m–2s–1) will produce darker lawns thus allowing for easier detection of plaques.
Note the number of plaque forming units (PFUs), plaque size, and morphology.
Choose a well-isolated plaque on a plate that contains less than 100 PFUs.
Harvest the plaque using a Pasteur pipette: gently press the tip of the pipette into the plaque to the bottom agar; using gentle suction, remove the plug.
Transfer the plug to 1 mL media and vortex briefly to break it up.
Place the tube at 4°C and allow the phages particle to elute from the plug overnight to form a plaque lysate.
Vortex and centrifuge the sample (ca.
12,000g for 10 min) to pellet cyanobacteria and agar.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube; typical titer of the plaque lysate can be 104 to 105 PFU mL–1.
Repeat steps 14 to 19 for a minimum of 3 plaques.
Choosing plaques with different morphologies may result in the isolation of different phages.
Adsorption of phage to cyanobacteria
Have everything ready to perform plaque assay:a. Plating cells, aliquoted, and set aside.

Set up adsorption cultures (e.g., 250 mL polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flasks with screw cap).
Fill flask with 100 mL host cells.
Add cyanophage stock of known titer to host at an MOI of ca. 0.01 and quickly mix to disperse the virus.
Immediately remove a subsample and dilute 100× for time zero: Transfer 15 µL to a tube containing 1.5 mL of ice cold media.
Vortex to mix.
Pellet host for 5 min at ca. 16,000g and 4°C; note the time.
Carefully remove a small aliquot (50 µL) of the supernatant to a new tube and keep cold for plaque assay; note time.
Place adsorption cultures under usual conditions (e.g., light and temp).
Repeat sampling at 15 min intervals for 1 to 1.5 h. Determine the concentration of viruses remaining in the supernatant for each time point by plaque assay.

These are your cells of interest; DO NOT DISCARD.
If needed, add 3 mL of MojoSort™ Buffer and repeat steps 10 and 11 with the magnetically labeled fraction up to two times, and then pool the unlabeled fractions.
Note: Repeating the magnetic separation increases the yield, without a strong impact on the purity.
The yield will typically increase about 8 – 10% with a second separation, and about 2 – 5% with a third separation.
The purity may decrease 1 – 2% with each separation.
Optional: Take a small aliquot before placing the tube in the magnet to monitor purity and yield.
Stellaris® RNA FISH Cells in Suspension Protocol
Centrifuge suspension cells (2 – 5 x 106 cells) in a 15 mL conical tube.

Cells can be stored at +2 to +8 °C in 70% ethanol up to a week before hybridization.
If frozen before using, warm the reconstituted probe solution to room temperature.
Mix well by vortexing, then centrifuge briefly.
To prepare the Hybridization Buffer containing probe, add 1 μL of probe stock solution to 100 μL of Hybridization Buffer, and then vortex and centrifuge (enough for one coverglass).
This creates a working probe solution of 125 nM.
This solution will be used on step 13.
Invert tube with fixed and permeabilized suspension cells several times to resuspend cells.
Then place 50- 500 μL of cells (depending on concentration) in a microcentrifuge tube.

Place a Kimwipe over the coverglass and apply gentle pressure over the surface of the coverglass, pressing it firmly onto the surface of the slide.
While applying pressure, be careful not to move the coverglass horizontally as this could result in sheared cells.
The Kimwipe will wick up excess mounting medium.
Seal the coverglass perimeter with clear nail polish, and allow to dry.
Proceed to Imaging.
Detection of protein-synthesizing microorganisms in the environment via bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT)
Directly add AHA or HPG using a sterile-filtered (0.2 μM), pH- adjusted (pH 7.0) stock solution yielding a final concentration of 1 nM to 1 mM.
Additionally, perform replicate experiments and include replicated incubations without AHA/HPG.
For L-2-amino-4-azidobutanoic acid (L-azidohomoalanine, AHA): Dissolve in nano-pure water, adjust to pH 7.0, filter sterilize (0.2 μm), and store in the dark at 4 C.
Prepare stock solutions of 1–100 mM.
For L-2-amino-5-hexynoic acid (L-homopropargylglycine, HPG): Dissolve in nano-pure water, adjust to pH 7.0, filter sterilize (0.2 μm), and store in the dark at 4 C.
Prepare stock solutions of 1–100 mM.
Fix cells according to standard protocols [34] immediately after sampling either by (1) fixation in 3% formaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (See Steps 3-6) or (2) by resuspending pelleted biomass in a 1:1 mix of PBS:EtOH.
(See Step 7) For fixation with PFA, pellet the biomass, remove the supernatant (SN), and resuspend cells in 3% PFA in PBS.
For aqueous samples, directly add PFA to reach a final concentration of 3% PFA.
Fix for either 3 h on ice or 1 h at RT.
After fixation, Pellet the biomass by centrifugation or filter onto 0.2 μm filters.
Wash with PBS to remove remaining PFA before resuspending biomass in 1:1 PBS: EtOH.
Store at -20°C.
Make sure to deposit PFA in the chemical waste.
For EtOH fixation, pellet biomass, remove supernatant, resuspend in 1:1 PBS:EtOH, and store at -20°C.
Immobilize biomass either on glass slides or filters.
Dry at 46°C or, if not available, at 37°C or RT.
Dehydrate and permeabilize cells by sequentially placing slides or filters for 3 min into 50 mL tubes that contain 50, 80, and 96% ethanol.
Dry biomass using pressurized air.
Pellet sample via centrifugation (16,100g or max.
setting for 5 min at RT) and resuspend in 250 μL 80% EtOH.
Mix by vortex and incubate for 3 min at RT.
Add 1.5 mL 96% EtOH, mix by vortex, and incubate for 3 min at RT.
Afterwards, pellet sample via centrifugation and resuspend in 221 μL PBS.
Removing small volumes of leftover EtOH is not necessary as it does not interfere with the click reaction.
If using immobilized biomass, after dehydration of the sample, prepare the dye premix by mixing 1.25μL of 20 mM CuSO4 solution with 2.50μL of 50 mM THPTA and 0.30μL of alkyne dye.
Allow to react for 3 min at RT in the dark.
We recommend to perform Cu(I)-catalyzed click chemistry at a dye concentration of 1-5μM (final concentration) to guarantee for best signal-to-noise ratios, but substantially lower or higher concentrations can be used, if necessary.

To elute DNA, add 10 µl of Buffer EB (10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.5) or water to the center of the membrane, let the column stand for 1 min, and then centrifuge for 1 min.
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the elution buffer is dispensed directly onto the center of the membrane for complete elution of bound DNA.
The average eluate volume is 9 µl from 10 µl elution buffer volume.Elution efficiency is dependent on pH.
The maximum elution efficiency is achieved between pH 7.0 and 8.5.
When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
The purified DNA can also be eluted in TE buffer (10 mM Tris·Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), but the EDTA may inhibit subsequent enzymatic reactions.
If the purified DNA is to be analyzed on a gel, add 1 volume of Loading Dye to 5 volumes of purified DNA.
Mix the solution by pipetting up and down before loading the gel.
Loading dye contains 3 marker dyes (bromophenol blue, xylene cyanol, and orange G) that facilitate estimation of DNA migration distance and optimization of agarose gel run time.
Refer to Table 3 (page 15) to identify the dyes according to migration distance and agarose gel percentage and type.

Fingerprinting aquatic virus communities using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
Using lint-free tissues, wash glass plates, spacers, and combs thoroughly with 70% ethanol.
Assemble the gel sandwich by placing the small glass plate on top of the large plate, being sure to correctly place a 1-mm spacer along each edge of the plate assembly.
To prevent current leakage and the resultant “smiles” in the bands near the edges of the gel, grease both sides of the spacers with as little as possible silicon grease to cover the full length of the spacer but only a quarter of the spacer width.
Attach the plate clamps and place the entire assembly into the casting stand.
Inspect the plate assembly to ensure that the two glass plates and the spacers form a flush surface along the sides, and ensure that all gaskets adequately seal the plate assembly.
Check the gradient maker and flush with sdH2O.
Empty pump tubing and attach pipette tip at the outlet tube to the top-middle of the gel chamber.
To optimize the gradient conditions for a new DGGE experiment (new primer sets, new sample type/habitat, etc.), we usually start with a relatively broad gradient (20% to 80% denaturant).
We then focus the gradient around the area of interest to include the highest and lowest bands in different samples.
Table 1 (guidelines) can be used to determine the appropriate composition of the denaturing gradient gel (16 × 16 cm) that has a total volume of 29 mL.
Make up two solutions of 14.5 mL each, a low denaturant concentration solution and a high denaturant concentration solution.
Mix the solutions A and B (guidelines) to the desired percentage.
After preparing the denaturing gel solutions, degas for 15 min and filter through a 0.45-mm syringe filter.
Immediately before casting the gel, add 145 µL 10% APS and 7.25 µL TEMED into each solution and swirl gently to mix.
At this point, you will have approximately 10 min to pour the gel.
Make sure the pump is off and the gradient maker-channel is closed (handle up).
Pour solution with the highest denaturant in the right leg of the gradient maker (at the pump side) and the solution with the lowest denaturant in the left leg.
Turn the magnetic stirrer on, while simultaneously starting the pump (5 mL/min).
Simultaneously, start the pump (5 mL/min) and move the handle of the gradient maker to horizontal position (channel open).
Use approximately 4–5 min to fill the gel.
Empty the tubing and flush thoroughly with sdH2O.
Insert the comb, flat or straight side down, making sure that there are no bubbles under the comb.
Different combs (16 or 20 wells) are available, depending on the number of samples that you want to run.
Cover gels with cling film and allow ~2 h for the gel to polymerize.
The gel can be kept at 4°C until the next day.
Prepare approximately 7 L of 1× TAE and fill the buffer chamber.
Put about 0.5 L aside for later use.
To enhance the circulation of the running buffer, place the tank on a magnet stirrer and add a magnetic stirrer bar in the bottom of the tank.
Preheat the buffer in the DCode apparatus to 60°C; this will take about 2 h. Attach the gel plates to the core assembly.
Loosen the clamps a quarter-turn counterclockwise to prevent breaking of the sandwich clamps (due to heat expansion).
Then place the core assembly into the heated buffer in the tank.
Switch off the magnetic stirrer (if loading in tank).
Flush each well with buffer using syringe with needle to remove any unpolymerized acrylamide and excess urea.
Flush each well with buffer again before loading approximately 10–50 µL of PCR products mixed with loading dye into each well.
To quantify PCR products, we recommend gel quantification using a DNA mass standard (e.g., Low DNA Mass ladder; Invitrogen) and commercially available gel quantification software such as Quantity One (Bio-Rad) or free software such as Image J (available for download at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html).
In the DGGE gel, load a marker on each side of the gel adjacent to the samples (markers can be custom made for each DGGE application using known PCR products, or common molecular weight markers can be used)  for determination of band positions, or comparisons of different gels.
Apply a loading voltage of 200 V for 5 min before starting the pump to circulate the buffer, then turn on the magnetic stirrer.
The length of the run and the running voltage depend on the size of the PCR products and the percentage of acrylamide/bis in the gel.
A good starting point is to run the gel at 60 V (about 20 mA for one gel) for 19 h. 
When the electrophoresis is complete, take apart the apparatus and remove the glass plates from the gel clamps.
Carefully separate the plates, leaving the gel exposed on the large plate.
Use the edge of the small plate to trim the well walls, but be sure to leave the leftmost wall slightly higher than the others for use as a gel orientation reference.
For easy manipulation, the gel can either be stained on the large plate or transferred to, stained on, and transported on a plastic sheet.
Stain the gel for 30 min in 50–500 mL fluorescent gel stain.
Destain the gel for 30 min in 1 × TAE.
Remember, the fluorescent dye binds to nucleic acids; therefore, it is important to minimize contact with skin, so gloves (powder-free) should be worn.
If staining in a container, use plastic and not glass, as the fluorescent dyes accumulate over time on glass surfaces.
Slide the gel off of the plastic sheet or large plate onto a UV transilluminator and view the gel.

Note: Keep MojoSort™ Buffer on ice throughout the procedure.
Filter the cells with a 40 μm cell strainer, centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 minutes, and resuspend in anappropriate volume of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Count and adjust the cell concentration to 1 x 107cells/mL.
Aliquot 100 μL of cell suspension (106 cells) into a new tube.
Add 10 μL of the Biotin‐CX3CR1 antibody, mix well and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.
Scale up the volume accordingly if separating more cells.
For example, add 100 μL for 1 x 107 cells.
When working with less than 106 cells, use indicated volumes for 106 cells.
Optional: Keep unused cells, or take an aliquot before adding the cocktail to monitor purity and yield.
Wash the cells by adding MojoSort™ Buffer up to 4 mL; centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes.
Discard supernatant and resuspend in 100 μL of MojoSort™ Buffer.
Resuspend the beads by vortexing, maximum speed, 5 touches.

Refer to the Sartorius user manual and online videos for tubing attachment and flow set-up.
For all tubing, keep the ends to be placed in the sample and filtrate as clean as possible once removing from the packaging.
To adapt the smaller cassette tubing to our lab’s pump head size, make sure to attach the size 25 Masterflex tubing first.
Keep clean/sterile the end to be placed in the phage sample.
If running more than one phage sample simultaneously, make sure to label all input and output tubing, cassettes and bottles or flasks with sample ID’s, and keep separate to prevent any phage cross contamination.
Per the Sartorius manual, prepare the cassette (aka: module) before use by pre-rinsing the system at full pressure to remove trace amounts of glycerine and sodium azide and check for any leaks at the tubing connections.
Place the input tubing into the 1 L bottle of 0.2 um filtered, sterile nanopure water.
Place the output return tubing in the same bottle and pump liquid through the system to purge any air pockets.
You will need ~500 ml of water per cassette, and you can set up two parallel cassettes to use the same bottle.
The recirculation rate should be in the range of 200-400 ml/min and suitable flow should exit the filtrate line.
If used, the pressure indicator should read approximately 2.5 bar.
This corresponds to a pump setting of around 60.
Allow 400 ml per cassette to pass into the filtrate collection.
Check for any leaks at connections.
Finally, drain the system and empty the filtrate flask.
To concentrate the phage sample, place the input and output lines into the initial lysate container (usually a 1L bottle).
If the container lid is off, place a piece of parafilm over the opening to minimize contamination and secure the tubing in place.
Pump the liquid through the system at the same rate and pressure as specified for the rinsing step above.
For two cassettes filtering one sample, a pump setting of around 60 corresponds to a filtrate production of about 250 ml per 14 min initially, but which may slow some as more concentrated sample is added to the recirculation.
Monitor the sample level and stop the pumping when volume reaches 100-200 ml to refill the bottle with more sample.
Also monitor the filtrate flask to prevent overflowing and discard (or keep, if desired) the filtrate down the sink (this should be free of phage!).
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml.
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system.
When the desired volume has been reached, reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min (pump setting around 10) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery.
Stop adding phage sample after you have concentrated 4 L to between 175 and 200 ml.
Note that about 15-20 ml are left in the system.
When the desired volume has been reached, reduce the recirculation rate to 20-40 ml/min (pump setting around 10) and recirculate the concentrated sample for 1-2 minutes to maximize recovery.
If there are > 4 L of sample to concentrate, begin the next fraction: place the input and return tubes into the next lysate sample bottle, parafilm cover, and repeat the concentration process (steps 5-8).
Then transfer the concentrated sample into a second 250 ml bottle and drain the remaining sample completely from the system.
To collect a final rinse from the filters for a more complete sample recovery, place 100 ml ASW salts into a clean 250 ml bottle.
Place the input and return tubing into the bottle, cover the top with parafilm and recirculate on lower speed until the volume is reduced to about 20 ml.
Then drain the system as before and collect the remaining rinse fraction into the bottle.
Even though the Vivaflow 50 cassettes are not reusable, they were kept until the concentration of phage sample was determined.
To store the cassettes, load them with ASW salts and keep at 4 °C.
Place 50 ml ASW salts into a sterile 50 ml tube and recirculate this through the filter and tubing to remove air bubbles.
Then either leave the open tubing ends in the media tube and cover with parafilm, or seal the tubing ends with tape.
For phage concentration analysis via SYBR slide preparation, collect 0.5 ml of each of the following samples.
Sample Fractions #1, #2 and Rinse.
Filtrate from beginning of the first 4 L concentration.
Filtrate from end of the first 4 L concentration. 
Footnotes:  1) In Feb 2016 experiments, sample fractions concentrations were determined before combining the two fractions for the next step.
The second fraction was more concentrated for both phage samples.
The rinse sample was not counted or used.
2) In all previous Vivaflow concentration trials, no particles were seen on SYBR slides for the filtrate samples, as should be expected.
Enumeration of virus particles in aquatic or sediment samples by epifluorescence microscopy
Prepare reagents.
Collect and prepare sample according to sample type.
Prepare slide labels with critical information such as the date, sample location, and volume filtered to keep track of the samples once they have been filtered and stained.
For every set of four samples to be stained, use a permanent pen to mark the bottom of a plastic Petri plate into four labeled sections.
For each filter that is to be prepared, add a 78- µL drop of 0.02-µm filtered dH2O on each section of the marked Petri plates.
Thaw a 40-µL vial of the stock SYBR solution and add 2 µL stock solution to each drop (78 µL) of sterile dH2O or buffer.
Mix the stain by gently pipetting up and down.
Place the Petri plates in the dark so that the stain is not bleached.
Prepare the antifade solution in a clean, sterilized 2-mL microcentrifuge tube.
Dilute the 10% (wt/vol) stock of p-phenylenediamine 1:100 using glycerol/PBS as the diluent.
Keep the solution on ice and protect it from light.
For each filter that is to be prepared, add a 80-µL drop of thawed Yo-Pro working solution on each section of the marked Petri plates.
Place a 9-cm-diameter filter paper soaked with 3 mL aqueous NaCl solution (0.3% wt/vol) in the lid of the Petri plates to prevent evaporation of the stain.
Connect a filtration unit for 25-mm filters to a vacuum source, ensuring the vacuum is ≤13 kPa.
Place a 0.45-µm nitrocellulose backing filter on each filter support, and overlay it with a thin layer of dH2O.
Carefully pick up a 0.02-µm Anodisc filter by its plastic ring and lay it over the wet backing filter, with the plastic ring facing upward.
If the sample has been preserved and frozen as described, thaw it in a 37°C water bath.
For a sample that has just been collected, fix it with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15–30 min at 4°C before preparing slides.
In addition, prepare duplicate control samples by fixing 1 mL of the 0.02-µm filtered water that was used to dilute the SYBR stain.
Because divalent cations interfere with the binding of the stain, seawater samples should be diluted to <7 psu with 0.02-µm filtered dH2O before filtration.
It is a good idea to make test slides (including a control with no sample added) to be sure an appropriate volume is filtered, that the procedure is working, and that the filters and reagents do not have viruses on or in them (some batches of Anodiscs have been covered with bacteria and viruses).
For most lake and coastal seawater samples, which have viral abundances of ~107 mL–1, 0.8–1.0 mL sample is added to the surface of the Anodisc filter while the vacuum is off.
Turn on the vacuum and suck the sample through the filter.
For oligotrophic or very deep ocean samples, it may be necessary to filter 4 mL or more.
Filter towers must be cleaned between samples.
Rinse the towers with 0.02-µm filtered dH2O followed by ethanol.
Dry with lint-free paper (e.g., Kimwipe).
Once the sample is filtered, remove the Anodisc with the vacuum still on.
Allow the filter to air-dry (typically a minute or less), until the surface is visibly dry.
Place the Anodisc, sample side up, on a drop of stain in the Petri dish.
Allow the filter to stain for 15 min in the dark.
Allow the filter to stain for 48 h in the dark, at room temperature.
Add a drop of dH2O on the backing filter, lay the stained Anodisc on top, and use the vacuum to remove any remaining fluid.
Some samples (e.g., sediments, vent fluid, and humic waters) may require the filters to be rinsed to reduce background fluorescence.
If so, while the vacuum is still on and the filter is damp, rinse the filter twice with 1 mL of 0.02-µm filtered dH2O.
Remove the Anodisc while the vacuum is on.
Place the Anodisc, sample-side up, on a 9-cm filter paper or Kimwipe in the dark, and allow the filter to dry until it appears opaque.
Place 12–15 µL antifade solution on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top.
Add ~20 µL antifade on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip.
Place 12–15 µL spectrophotometric-grade glycerol on a labeled glass slide and lay the dry Anodisc on top.
Add ~20 µL glycerol on top of the Anodisc and cover with a coverslip.
Remove any air bubbles that are trapped under the coverslip by gently pressing on the surface.
The slides can be counted immediately or stored frozen at –20°C for at least 4 months with no decrease in estimates of viral abundance.
Count the viruses at 1000× magnification using a 100× oilemersion objective.
Begin by checking the test filters to ensure that the reagents or filters were not contaminated and the filtered volumes were appropriate.
Check each slide before counting to make sure that the filter is evenly stained and that the viruses are on a single plane of focus and not suspended in the mounting medium and are evenly distributed across the filter.
Using the ocular reticule, select an appropriate number of grid squares so that there are 10–100 stained viruses in each field.
Estimate the abundance of viruses by counting at least 20 random fields.
Keep a tally of the number of particles in each field so that the variation in abundance of particles among fields can be determined.
For each sample, record the number of particles counted in each field, the number of fields counted, the area of the field, and the volume of sample filtered.
The abundance of viruses mL–1 (Vt) in the sample = Vc ÷ Fc × At ÷ Af ÷ S, where Vc = total number of viruses counted, Fc = total number of fields counted, At = surface area of the filter (µm2) (see note below), Af = area of each field (µm2), and S = volume of sample filtered (mL).
The total number of particles counted will determine the size of the 95% confidence intervals on the estimates of viral abundance.
By assuming a Poisson distribution, the 95% confidence intervals can be estimated using the following equations (Suttle 1993):

Full Contact Microbiology (a.k.a Diatom Transformation via Bacterial Conjugation)
Grow the diatom culture to mid-log phase (≈ 8.0E6 cells/ml for Phaeodactylum tricornutum grown on F/2 media or 5.0 E7 cell/ml when grown on BG-11).
We have investigated transformation efficiency throughout the growth curve and found this to be the sweetspot.
Grow 1 mL of E. coli culture containing both the mobillity plasmid (Pta-MOB) and carrier plasmid, overnight (16-20 hrs) in LB+antibiotics, for each planned transformation.
(We grow them at 37°C at 270 rpm in a shaking incubator.).
On the day of transformation, use the overnight culture to inoculate 50 mL of fresh LB+antibiotic, 1:50 dilution, for each planned transformation.Grow to an OD600 of 0.8 - 1.0 (37°C with 270 rpm shaking).This takes about 3-4 hours.
During the 3-4 hours the E. coli culture is growing, measure the Phaeodactylum tricornutum cell concentration with a FlowCam or haemocytometer to calculate the required volume needed to collect 2.5E8 cells for each transformation.
For each transformation, centrifuge 50 mL of E. coli culture and the required Phaeodactylum tricornutum volume at 4000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Resuspend E. coli pellet in 500 μL of SOC medium.Resuspend P. tricornutum pellet in 500 μL of L1 medium.
Note: The diatom and E. coli cultures should be centrifuged at around the same time to minimize the amount of time they spend concentrated.
In a 1.5 mL tube mix 200 μl of E. coli cells with 200 μl of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells.
Negative control:   In a 1.5 mL tube mix 200 μl of SOC medium with 200 μl of Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells.
Note: Incubate and treat the negative control plates identically to conjugation plates.
Spread the mixture (400 μL) on Conjugation Plates.
(0.5x BG-11 with 5% LB and 1% agar).
Incubate plates for 90 minutes at 30°C in the dark.
Move plates to light incubator (18°C and 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1) for 2 days.
Collect cells by adding 1 mL of L1 medium.
Use a cell scraper to concentrate cells and medium to one side of the plate.
Transfer resuspended cells to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with a P1000 pipette and filter tips.
Spread 200 μl of the cell suspension on a Selection Plate.
Incubate at 18°C and 100 μmol photons m-2 s-1 until colonies appear.
After a minimum of 8-12 days, untransformed Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells die off, and colonies of transformed cells begin to appear – in some cases, this can take 3-4 weeks.
Alternatively selection can be done in liquid BG-11 Selection media using eGFP as a reporter and sorted using FACS.

Construction of shotgun libraries from RNA virus assemblages
Cesium chloride gradient is conducted to purify viruses from viral concentrate of seawater as described in others chapters of this book (Wommack et al. 2010, this volume; Steward and Culley 2010, this volume).
Each density fraction is then extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer with the following exception (see annotation).
Remove contaminating DNA from RNA preparations with the Turbo DNAfree kit (Applied Biosystems) as described in the protocol provided with the kit.
In preparation for cDNA synthesis, 10 µL purified RNA viral template is mixed with a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM and 1 µM and 5 nM final concentrations of FR26RV-N and FR40RV-T primer, respectively.
The reaction is heated to 65°C then cooled on ice to allow the primers to anneal.
While still on ice, DTT (0.5 mM final conc.) is added to the reaction as an enzyme stabilization reagent with 40 U RNase OUT (Invitrogen) to protect the sample form RNAse activity.
The complementary DNA strand is synthesized with 200 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase.
The reaction is incubated initially at 25°C for 10 min so that the hexamer 3′ end of primer FR26RV-N and the poly(T)20 3′ end of primer FR40RV-T remain annealed to the template while cDNA synthesis commences.
The temperature is then increased to 50°C, the temperature at which Superscript III’s processivity is highest, for 60 min.
After the hour-long incubation at 50°C, the first strand synthesis reaction is heated immediately to 94°C for 3 min and then rapidly cooled on ice.
A complementary second strand is subsequently synthesized at 37°C for 60 min with the addition of 2.5 U of Klenow Fragment, 3′-5′ exo – (New England Biolabs).
The Klenow reaction is terminated with a final incubation at 75°C for 10 min.
One PCR reaction contains 5 µL of template taken directly from the second strand synthesis reaction, 40 pM of FR20RV primer (see Table 1), a final dNTP concentration of 0.2 mM, 1 × Gold buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 U of Ampligold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 50 µL.
The reaction is incubated at 94°C for 10 min to fully denature the template and activate the hot start enzyme.
Followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min.
Annealing at 65°C for 1 min.
Extension at 72°C for 2 min.
A final extension for 13 min that permits the completion of complementary strand synthesis.
Before gel separation, we purify and concentrate the PCR reactions with a MinElute PCR cleanup column (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer.
Purified PCR products are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 × SYBR safe stain (Invitrogen) and 0.5 × TBE buffer.
Bands of DNA of the appropriate size range are excised and purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
If the sample is to be cloned for Sanger sequencing, we recommend eluting DNA from the column with three washes of 10 µL nuclease-free water in preparation for the PCRTerminator (Lucigen) end repair reaction.
For the cloning protocol, please refer to the “Cloning and sequencing” section of "A degenerate primer reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction–based protocol to determine the diversity of picorna-like viruses".
The relevant virus-containing gradient fractions are collected.
The CsCl in the Virus-containing gradient fractions are removed by buffer exchange using a centrifugal ultrafiltration unit with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 30 KD to 100 KD (Microcon, Millipore or Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences) as described in Steward and Culley (2010).
Viruses are then recovered by eluting in 3 × 50 µL of 0.02-filtered SM buffer.
